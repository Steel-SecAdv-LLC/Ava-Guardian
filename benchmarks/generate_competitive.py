Full-surface competitive positioning page.

Renders `benchmarks/competitive.html` from the two measurement artefacts:

  * `benchmarks/multi_library_results.json` — native C/C++ harness
    (`multi_library_bench.cpp`) covering every AMA primitive that at least one
    other library on the host also exposes, across OpenSSL, libsodium, wolfSSL,
    Botan, Nettle, libgcrypt and mbedTLS.
  * `benchmarks/pqc_results.json` — the ML-KEM / ML-DSA head-to-head
    (`pqc_comparative_bench.py`), which runs at the Python layer because
    OpenSSL 4.0.1 via `cryptography` is the only peer on the host that
    implements those at all.

Why a generator and not a static page
-------------------------------------
Every number on the page comes from JSON produced by a run, so the numeric
content cannot drift from the measurement the way a committed table does.
Three structures in this file are hand-maintained and say so on the page:
COVERAGE (each cell records the result of a runtime capability probe or a
benchmark row taken at measurement time — the probe source is quoted in the
methodology section — but the matrix itself is a transcription), VERSIONS
(eight of the nine entries are pinned string literals, because the harness
does not record peer versions), and NOTES (engineering prose, which must be
reconciled against the rendered numbers whenever the JSON changes).

Design rules (see the project's data-viz guidance)
--------------------------------------------------
* Two categorical series only — AMA and the fastest peer for that primitive.
  Nine libraries do not become nine hues; the table carries per-library
  identity, the chart carries the comparison. Both hues validated for CVD
  separation against both surfaces (worst adjacent dE 24.7 light / 26.8 dark
  against a >=8 target, normal-vision 33.6 / 31.8).
* Log axis wherever the range spans more than a decade — AES-GCM alone runs
  from 203 MB/s to 10.5 GB/s.
* Every bar carries a direct value label, so nothing is encoded by colour
  alone, and the full numeric table is the chart's table view.
* Dark mode is selected, not flipped: its own validated steps from the same
  ramps under both the OS media query and the explicit theme toggle.

whole overlapping surface: {n_total} measured primitives across {nlibs} native libraries
plus OpenSSL 4.0.1 for the post-quantum pair, with the results AMA loses reported at the

<h2><span class="num">5</span>How this was measured</h2>
<div class="callout">
<b>One host, one process, one set of buffers.</b> Every library is driven through its
own native API in the same binary, on the same input, with identical iteration counts
and best-of-5 round selection — the minimum round, because scheduler noise only ever
adds time. The CPU clock is <b>measured</b> at {freq} GHz via <code>rdtsc</code> against
<code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code>, not assumed, so cycles/byte is correct on this host rather
than on the host the harness was written on.
</div>
<div class="callout">
<b>Every verify is checked for success before it is timed.</b> An earlier revision of
this harness shared one signature buffer between the sign and verify loops. Because
DER-encoded ECDSA signatures vary between 70 and 72 bytes, the length went stale, verify
rejected in a few hundred cycles, and the table reported 8.5 M verifies/sec for wolfSSL
P-256 — a rejection path being timed, not a verification. Signatures for the verify loop
are now produced once into a buffer the sign loop never touches, and a row whose verify
does not return success is dropped rather than published.
</div>
<div class="callout">
<b>INVARIANT-36 holds.</b> That invariant forbids treating another implementation's
output as ground truth for correctness. No library here is consulted as a correctness
oracle — every peer is a stopwatch reference only, and AMA's correctness continues to
come from NIST ACVP and Wycheproof vectors in its own suite.
</div>
<div class="callout">
<b>Where the post-quantum numbers come from.</b> The system OpenSSL 3.0.13 implements
no ML-KEM, ML-DSA or SLH-DSA — probed, not assumed. The only peer on this host that
implements any of them is OpenSSL 4.0.1, reached through <code>cryptography</code>
49.0.0, so that pair is measured at the Python layer where both sides pay comparable
call overhead. It is a different measurement plane from the native C rows and is
labelled as such rather than merged into them.
</div>
<div class="callout">
<b>The post-quantum rows are also from a different host.</b>
<code>benchmarks/pqc_results.json</code> was captured where <code>cryptography</code>
49.0.0 (OpenSSL 4.0.1) was installed; the host this page's native rows were measured
on carries 41.0.7, which exposes no ML-KEM or ML-DSA, so those rows cannot be
re-measured here and were carried forward unchanged. They are unaffected by the
symmetric and elliptic-curve kernel work recorded in the changelog, which touched
no lattice code. Read them as a prior record, not as a measurement of this host.

from those files' provenance rather than from the working tree. The PEER LIBRARY
