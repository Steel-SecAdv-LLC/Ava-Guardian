"""Measure the 3R timing-anomaly detector — and gate on the measurement.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``monitoring.py`` ships a timing-anomaly detector.  Until this script there
was **no measurement of whether it detects anything**; the first measurement
(2026-08-16, commit 8d72b8c) was negative on every axis: ``threshold_sigma``
was inert (identical alarm sets at sigma 2/3/5), the fixed Gaussian MAD
threshold produced a 12.52% false-alarm rate on clean heavy-tailed traffic
(one in eight operations flagged), recall on a 30% sustained shift was
17.6%, and the whole apparatus tied a k-NN and a quantile baseline that cost
one line each.  The detector was rebuilt against that evidence — robust
score with an empirically calibrated per-operation false-alarm budget, plus
a distribution-free sign CUSUM for sustained shifts — and this script is now
the regression gate that keeps every one of those failures fixed:

  * clean-traffic false-alarm rate must stay within the declared budget,
  * a smaller budget must produce fewer alarms (budget is live),
  * a larger sigma floor must produce fewer alarms (sigma is live),
  * a 30% sustained shift must be alerted promptly and its regime covered,
  * and the point path must retain the same order of spike-ranking quality
    as the best trivial baseline at a matched alarm budget (measured ratio
    floor — the baselines rank somewhat better there, and that is stated,
    not hidden; see the gate comment for the full framing).

Run with ``--gate`` to enforce (CI does); without it the report is printed
and the exit code still reflects the gate so the lane cannot rot silently.

THE FAIRNESS RULE
-----------------
The baselines produce scores; the shipped detector is a binary rule.  Every
baseline is calibrated on the SAME stream to raise the SAME number of alarms
the shipped detector raised, and precision/recall/F1 are reported at that
matched alarm budget.  Equal alarm budget is the only comparison an operator
cares about: alarms cost review time, so the question is which detector
spends a fixed budget better.

All detectors run **online** and see the samples in the same order.  No
detector sees the future.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN ANOMALY — AND WHAT THIS EVIDENCE IS
-----------------------------------------------------
Ground truth is **synthetic injection**: spikes (an isolated operation takes
k x longer) and sustained shifts (a regime change from some point onward)
are injected at known indices into a stream of real wall-clock timings of a
real primitive through the shipped API.  This measures detector behaviour
against *known-position synthetic* anomalies over a *real* noise
distribution.  It is NOT evidence derived from observed attack traffic, and
no claim built on this file may present it as such — the JSON record carries
``evidence_class`` stating exactly this.

The comparison is deliberately unflattering and reported as measured: on
isolated spikes at a matched budget, the top-N KNN baseline ranks about as
well as the calibrated point path — while needing the shipped detector's own
calibrated alarm count as an oracle to run at all.  Measured mean F1 ratio
(shipped / best baseline): 0.95-0.99 on the deterministic gate streams, and
0.65-1.12 across runs on live host timings, where the base stream dominates
the spread.  Neither range supports a claim that the shipped point path
ranks isolated spikes better; it ranks them comparably.

What the machinery buys, stated no more strongly than the measurement
supports:

* The calibrated false-alarm budget.  No baseline has one — a top-N rule
  needs an N, and here it is handed the shipped detector's own alarm count.
  This is gated (clean-FAR, budget-monotonic, sigma-floor).
* A sustained-shift EVENT with a bounded detection delay.  The baselines
  have no event or regime concept at all, and their trailing window absorbs
  a new regime within WINDOW samples, so they cannot raise one — that is a
  structural fact about the algorithms, not a measured advantage.  What the
  measurement does NOT show is a large F1 advantage on the shift stream:
  the gaps there are inside this file's own tie band, and on live timings
  the shift row is further confounded because the host is already in the
  regime state for a substantial fraction of clean traffic (printed on every
  run).  The gated claim is the event and its delay, not the F1.

Stdlib only, by INVARIANT-1 habit — KNN on 1-D windows is a sort.

    """A 30% sustained regime change must be alerted, promptly, and covered.

    Four requirements on the injected shift stream:
      1. NO shift event before the onset — otherwise what follows is being
         credited to an injection that did not exist yet;
      2. at least one shift EVENT at or after the onset;
      3. the first such event lands within 150 samples of onset (the
         re-baseline horizon is 300, so a detection later than half of it is a
         regression); measured delay 80 / 45 / 68 / 29 at 1,000 / 2,000 /
         4,000 / 8,000 samples, 68 at the 4,000 CI runs;
      4. the regime state covers >= 70% of the window onset..onset+300;
         measured 0.73 / 0.85 / 0.77 / 0.90 at those same sample counts, 0.77
         at the 4,000 CI runs.
    8d72b8c had no event concept and flagged 17.6% of the regime.

    Requirement 1 is the one that forced this gate onto a deterministic
    stream.  On live timings the detector legitimately enters the shift state
    for the host's own frequency changes; when that happened before the
    injection, the CUSUM re-baselined onto the already-shifted level and the
    injected shift raised no event at all, while the coverage figure was
    satisfied by samples that predated it.  The gate then failed, or passed
    for the wrong reason, depending on the host — 7 failures in 30 runs
    measured here.  The live numbers are still measured and reported; the
    pass/fail decision is taken where an event can only come from the
    injection.

    MEASURED AND STATED PLAINLY: at a matched alarm budget a top-N KNN
    baseline ranks isolated spikes about as well as the calibrated point path.
    That comparison hands the baseline an oracle — its N is the shipped
    detector's own calibrated alarm count, and a top-N rule has no false-alarm
    control of its own, so it is not deployable without one — which is why the
    contract is "same order of ranking quality", not "wins".

    seeded streams at a fixed count it was 0.947-0.963.  The previous floor of
    0.7 was set from live-timing runs whose mean ratio ranged 0.652-1.123, i.e.
    it sat inside the statistic's own spread and one run in 25 failed it with
    nothing wrong; the range 0.80-0.98 that MONITORING.md published described
    neither those runs nor these.  Each stream gets its own base, so the
