AMA Cryptography Benchmark Runner
================================

Performance regression detection for CI/CD pipelines.
Compares current performance against baseline.json and fails if
any benchmark regresses more than the configured threshold.

Usage:
    python benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py [--verbose]

Refreshing a baseline is deliberately NOT a flag on this runner.
`--update-baseline` used to be accepted here and then ignored — the parsed value
was never read, so a maintainer recalibrating floors saw a normal green run and
believed baseline.json had been rewritten.  Baselines are edited by hand, and
every changed line needs a justification entry that
`benchmarks/check_baseline_justification.py` enforces; an automatic write-back
would route around that gate.

Exit codes:
    0 - All benchmarks within acceptable range
    1 - Performance regression detected (slower than the operative tolerance)
    2 - Error running benchmarks

On the operative tolerance: `thresholds.regression_threshold_percent` (10) is
only a FALLBACK.  Every primitive in both shipped baselines carries its own
`tolerance_percent`, and a per-primitive value overrides the global one, so
the number that actually gates a run is never 10 in the shipped
configuration — it is 45 on `benchmarks/baseline.json` (x86-64) and 15 or 25
on `benchmarks/arm-baseline.json`.  Those values are derived from each lane's
measured noise and the reasoning is recorded in each file's
`metadata.description`: the x86 lane is a coarse safety net over a shared,
contended runner, and the ARM lane is the precision gate.  This docstring
previously advertised ">10%", which reads as a much tighter gate than the one
that runs.

#: Minimum wall-clock a single timed batch must span, in seconds.
#:
#: The per-call ``iterations`` defaults (20-100) were chosen per primitive and
#: are three orders of magnitude apart in cost, so they bought wildly different
#: amounts of signal: 20 ML-DSA-65 signatures is about 6 ms of measurement, and
#: the whole 19-benchmark suite finished in roughly 0.4 s of wall clock on the
#: CI runner.  On a shared, unpinned GitHub-hosted runner a single scheduler
#: preemption is larger than that, so the reported number was dominated by
#: whatever else the host was doing.  Observed directly: three consecutive runs
#: of one unchanged binary measured 917, 1845 and 3086 ops/sec for
#: ``dilithium_sign`` -- a 3.4x spread with the code held constant, against a
#: 10% regression threshold.  A gate whose noise exceeds its threshold by 34x
#: cannot fail for the reason it claims to, which is the failure mode
#: ``tests/test_benchmark_baseline_freshness.py`` was written about.
#:
#: Batches are therefore sized from a calibration run rather than fixed, so
#: every primitive gets a comparable amount of signal regardless of its cost.
_MIN_SAMPLE_SECONDS = 0.15

#: Timed batches per benchmark; the fastest is reported.
#:
#: Throughput noise on a shared runner is one-sided -- interference can only
#: make an operation look slower, never faster -- so the fastest of several
#: batches is the best available estimate of the machine's actual capability
#: and is far more stable than the mean.  This is the estimator
#: ``benchmark_operation_best_of`` was written for and applied to the two
#: composite package benchmarks; it is now what every benchmark gets, from
#: ``benchmark_operation`` itself, which is why neither composite calls
#: ``benchmark_operation_best_of`` any more — doing so on top of
#: ``_SAMPLING_REPEATS`` multiplied the two and sampled one row 25 times while
#: publishing 5.
_ROUNDS = 3

#: Independent repeats of a whole benchmark, per primitive, beyond ``_ROUNDS``.
#:
#: ``_ROUNDS`` batches inside one call remove most WITHIN-call noise.  They do
#: not remove BETWEEN-run noise, and that is what a regression floor is exposed
#: to: the number a CI job publishes is the output of one whole run.
#:
#: Measured rather than assumed.  Five complete suite runs on an idle host
#: (4 vCPU, `taskset -c 0-3`, nothing else executing — the sanitiser and dudect
#: sweeps were drained first, because an earlier attempt taken alongside them
#: produced a different and useless answer):
#:
#:   * Two of the five runs were globally slow — mean throughput 96.1% and
#:     97.3% of the per-primitive best, against 98.6-98.9% for the other three.
#:     Interference lands on a whole run, not on one primitive.
#:   * Discarding each primitive's single worst observation collapses every
#:     spread to <= 6.4%, and 16 of 19 to <= 4%.
#:
#: So the fix is more independent observations, not a longer window: the
#: estimator already keeps the fastest, throughput noise is one-sided, and one
#: extra observation is what turns "this run was unlucky" into "this run was
#: unlucky and the other two were not".  Since these numbers become FLOORS, a
#: more robust estimate tightens the gate rather than loosening it.
#:
#: The listed primitives are exactly those whose cross-run spread exceeded 7%
#: over those five runs — 7% being the point at which the spread of the
#: measurement starts to be comparable to the tightest tolerance any baseline
#: carries (15%, on the ARM lane).  Two shapes appear in the list, and both are
#: real: the rejection-sampled ML-DSA family and the composites containing one
#: (under FIPS 204's deterministic variant the rejection count is a constant
#: per (key, message) pair, and the 256-input pool fixes only the message
#: half — the key is redrawn per run), and the very cheap primitives, whose
#: short windows make them the most exposed to a scheduling burst.
#:
#: Result, five more runs after the change, same host and conditions:
#: primitives over 7% cross-run spread went from 9 to 4, and every cheap
#: primitive landed at or under 2% (SHA3-256 9.0% -> 0.9%, HKDF 10.2% -> 0.8%,
#: HMAC 9.0% -> 1.1%, the three Ed25519 lanes 8.5-11.0% -> 0.8-1.2%,
#: ``full_package_verify`` 18.1% -> 3.5%).
#:
#: The ML-DSA family is the honest residue: 5-15% on THIS host, and the cause
#: is visible in the run-level data rather than inferred — one of the five runs
#: had a mean throughput of 93.7% of the per-primitive best across the ML-DSA
#: and package benchmarks while sitting at 97.9% overall.  These are the
#: longest-running benchmarks in the suite, so a whole-run stall on a contended
#: 4-vCPU VM lands hardest on them, and no number of repeats inside that run
#: escapes it.  The canonical measurement environment for the floors is the CI
#: runner fleet, where the ARM lane records <= 3% for deterministic primitives
#: and <= 1.2x for ``dilithium_sign`` after the 256-input pool; the floors in
#: ``benchmarks/*.json`` are measured there and are deliberately NOT
#: recalibrated from a developer VM.
#:
#: Cost is bounded and paid where it buys something: 11 primitives x 2 extra
#: repeats plus 2 composites x 4, at ~0.5 s of window each, is roughly 15 s
#: added to a run.
#:
#: ``tests/test_benchmark_baseline_infra.py`` pins that every name here is a
#: registered benchmark, so a rename cannot silently drop one back to a single
#: measurement.
_EXTRA_SAMPLED_ROUNDS = 3

#: The composites need more than the rest.  Each performs a whole hybrid sign

#: which is progress but not enough, and five brings it inside the band.

    Benchmark an operation and return operations per second.

    ``iterations`` is a *floor*, not the batch size.  Batches are grown until
    a timed batch spans at least ``_MIN_SAMPLE_SECONDS`` of measured
    wall-clock time, so a cheap primitive gets many more iterations than an
    expensive one and both are measured over a comparable window.  ``rounds``
    full-window batches are collected and the fastest is reported (see
    ``_ROUNDS``).

    A batch qualifies as full-window on its own measured elapsed time, never
    on a predicted iteration count.  The sampling rule exists to keep a
    lucky-high rate off a short window out of the published number, and the
    measured window enforces that directly: ``rate = batch / elapsed`` with
    ``elapsed >= _MIN_SAMPLE_SECONDS`` *is* a full-window measurement,
    whatever the fastest rate observed elsewhere in the run happens to be.
    Qualification by predicted count (``batch >= fastest_rate * window``) was
    tried first and hard-failed legitimate runs on shared runners: every
    marginally faster observation raised the prediction, revoked the batches
    already credited, and restarted the count, so the attempt budget drained
    on re-validation instead of measurement.  A batch that spanned the window
    when it ran does not stop having done so because a later batch ran
    faster.  On a noisy host the two rules point in opposite directions —
    most batches run *slower* than the fastest rate seen, which lengthens
    their window (credit under this rule) while leaving their iteration count
    under each newly raised prediction (revocation under the old one).

    Sizing still keys off the fastest rate seen anywhere in the run, because
    throughput noise is one-sided: interference can only make an operation
    look slower than it is, never faster.  A slow batch therefore cannot
    shrink the sizing target, and a small batch that spans the window only
    because it stalled is credited (its rate can only be pessimistic, and the
    fastest round is what ships) but does not lock in its size for the
    remaining rounds.

    An operation too cheap to span the window inside ``_MAX_ITERATIONS``
    iterations is credited at the cap — the same ceiling
    ``_required_batch`` has always applied to the predicted target.  An
    under-sampled run still raises: fewer than ``rounds`` credited batches is
    a failure to MEASURE, and this function does not return numbers it cannot
    stand behind.
