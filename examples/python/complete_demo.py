AMA Cryptography Complete Feature Demonstration
==============================================

Comprehensive demonstration of all AMA Cryptography capabilities:
- Algorithm-agnostic cryptographic API
- Hierarchical deterministic key derivation
- Key rotation and management
- Hybrid classical+PQC signatures
- Double-helix evolution engine (all 18+ variants)
- Performance benchmarking

.. warning::

   **DEMONSTRATION CODE — NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

   This walkthrough favours a single readable script over safe operations:

   * The key-store ``master_password`` is a throwaway generated with
     ``secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`` and never persisted; a real deployment must
     source the passphrase from an operator prompt, a secrets manager, or an
     HSM.
   * The key store is created inside a temporary directory that is deleted on
     exit — keys created here are unrecoverable by design.
   * The double-helix / 3R sections are **non-cryptographic** analytics and
     must not be relied on for any security property (see the module
     docstring of ``ama_cryptography.double_helix_engine``).

   See ``IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`` before adapting any of this for real use.

    """Stop a legacy output encoding from killing the demo mid-run.

    This script prints check/cross verdicts and Greek letters in its labels. On
    Windows, Python uses the *locale* encoding — cp1252 on a default install —
    for stdout whenever it is redirected rather than attached to a console, so
    a user doing ``python complete_demo.py > out.txt``, or any CI job capturing
    the output, got::

        UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u2713'

    part-way through, followed by a *second* traceback from the ``except``
    handler trying to print ``✗`` with the same encoder.  The demo died
    somewhere in the middle with two stack traces and no summary.

    Reconfiguring to UTF-8 fixes the redirected case outright and is a no-op on
    a console, which Python already drives as UTF-8 on Windows.  ``errors``
    falls back to ``replace`` so that a stream which genuinely cannot represent
    a character degrades to ``?`` rather than aborting: a demo that prints a
    slightly wrong glyph has still demonstrated something, and one that raises
    has not.

    Deliberately done here rather than by setting ``PYTHONUTF8=1`` in CI. The
    environment variable would make the *test* pass while leaving the defect
    in place for every user who runs the script by hand.
