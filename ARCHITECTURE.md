## System Overview

### Purpose

Ava Guardian ♱ provides cryptographic protection for structured data (referred to as "DNA Codes" within the system) using a hybrid classical/quantum-resistant signature scheme. The system is designed for long-term data integrity assurance (50+ years) in environments where quantum computing threats must be considered.

### Scope

This architecture covers the core cryptographic engine, key management system, ethical integration framework, and supporting infrastructure. Out of scope are application-specific integrations, network transport security, and external HSM implementations.

### Non-Goals

The following are explicitly not goals of this architecture:

- General-purpose encryption services (the system focuses on signing and integrity)
- Real-time streaming cryptographic operations
- Hardware-level cryptographic acceleration
- Certificate authority or PKI infrastructure

## Architectural Principles

### Design Philosophy

The Ava Guardian ♱ architecture is built on the following foundational principles:

**Security Through Mathematical Rigor**: All security claims are backed by formal proofs or reduction arguments to well-studied cryptographic assumptions. No security-by-obscurity mechanisms are employed.

**Defense in Depth**: Six independent cryptographic layers ensure that compromise of any single layer does not compromise the overall system security. Each layer provides distinct security properties.

**Quantum Readiness**: Primary signature algorithms are selected for resistance to known quantum attacks. The system is designed to remain secure against adversaries with access to large-scale quantum computers.

**Ethical Integration**: Ethical constraints are mathematically bound to cryptographic operations through the key derivation process, ensuring that ethical metadata cannot be separated from cryptographic proofs.

**Standards Compliance**: All cryptographic primitives conform to published NIST and IETF standards. No custom or experimental cryptographic constructions are used.

**Performance Efficiency**: Cryptographic operations are optimized to maintain throughput exceeding 1,000 operations per second with less than 4% overhead for ethical integration.

### Architectural Constraints

The following constraints govern architectural decisions:

1. All cryptographic operations must use approved NIST or IETF algorithms
2. Key material must never be logged or exposed in error messages
3. Constant-time operations must be used for all security-critical comparisons
4. The system must degrade gracefully when optional components are unavailable
5. All public interfaces must validate inputs before processing

## Cryptographic Architecture

### Cryptographic Primitive Selection

| Primitive | Algorithm | Standard | Security Level |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Hash Function | SHA3-256 | NIST FIPS 202 | 128-bit collision resistance |
| Message Authentication | HMAC-SHA3-256 | RFC 2104 + FIPS 202 | 256-bit key, 128-bit security |
| Classical Signature | Ed25519 | RFC 8032 | 128-bit classical security |
| Quantum-Resistant Signature | ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium) | NIST FIPS 204 | 192-bit quantum security |
| Key Derivation | HKDF-SHA3-256 | RFC 5869 | 256-bit derived keys |
| Timestamping | RFC 3161 TSA | RFC 3161 | Third-party attestation |

### Cryptographic Layer Stack

The system implements six independent security layers, applied sequentially:

```
Layer 6: RFC 3161 Trusted Timestamp (optional)
         |
Layer 5: ML-DSA-65 Quantum-Resistant Signature
         |
Layer 4: Ed25519 Classical Digital Signature
         |
Layer 3: HMAC-SHA3-256 Message Authentication
         |
Layer 2: SHA3-256 Content Hash
         |
Layer 1: Canonical Length-Prefixed Encoding
         |
      [Input Data]
```

**Layer 1 - Canonical Encoding**: Input data is encoded using a deterministic length-prefixed format that prevents concatenation attacks and ensures identical inputs always produce identical encoded outputs.

**Layer 2 - Content Hashing**: SHA3-256 produces a 256-bit digest of the canonically encoded data. This digest serves as the binding commitment for all subsequent cryptographic operations.

**Layer 3 - Message Authentication**: HMAC-SHA3-256 provides symmetric authentication using a derived key. This layer enables efficient verification when the HMAC key is available.

**Layer 4 - Classical Signature**: Ed25519 provides a compact (64-byte) digital signature with 128-bit classical security. This layer ensures compatibility with existing verification infrastructure.

**Layer 5 - Quantum-Resistant Signature**: ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium Level 3) provides a lattice-based signature resistant to known quantum attacks. Signature size is approximately 3,293 bytes.

**Layer 6 - Trusted Timestamp**: Optional RFC 3161 timestamp from a trusted third-party authority provides non-repudiation and proof of existence at a specific time.

### Key Sizes and Parameters

| Component | Size | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Master Secret | 256 bits | CSPRNG-generated root key |
| HMAC Key | 256 bits | Derived via HKDF |
| Ed25519 Private Key | 256 bits | Seed for key generation |

| ML-DSA-65 Public Key | 1,952 bytes | Lattice-based public key |
| ML-DSA-65 Signature | ~3,293 bytes | Lattice-based signature |
| SHA3-256 Output | 256 bits | Collision-resistant digest |
| HKDF Salt | 256 bits | Optional, zeros if not provided |

## Ethical Integration Framework

### Overview

The Ethical Integration Framework mathematically binds ethical metadata to cryptographic operations through the HKDF info parameter. This ensures that derived keys are cryptographically dependent on the ethical context, making it impossible to separate ethical constraints from the cryptographic proof.

### Ethical Pillar Structure

The system defines 12 ethical pillars organized into four triads. Each pillar has a symbolic identifier and a weight value. The sum of all weights equals 12.0, ensuring balanced representation.

**Triad 1 - Foundation**
- Eris: Balanced consideration of competing interests
- Eden: Harmonious system growth and sustainability
- Veritas: Truth and validation in all operations

**Triad 2 - Expansion**
- X: Accommodation of unknown future requirements
- Caduceus: Balanced exchange and fair dealing
- Dev: Continuous development and improvement

**Triad 3 - Wisdom**
- Sophia: Integration of diverse knowledge sources
- Minerva: Strategic decision-making capability
- Athena: Practical application of wisdom

**Triad 4 - Transcendence**
- Isis: Regenerative and self-healing properties
- Thoth: Preservation and transmission of knowledge
- Hermes: Connectivity and communication

### Mathematical Integration

The ethical context is integrated into key derivation as follows:

```
ethical_vector = serialize(pillars, weights, symbols)
ethical_signature = SHA3-256(ethical_vector)[:16]  // 128-bit truncation
enhanced_info = application_context || ethical_signature
derived_key = HKDF-SHA3-256(master_secret, salt, enhanced_info, length=32)
```

This construction ensures that any modification to the ethical pillars produces a different derived key, cryptographically binding the ethical context to all subsequent operations.

### Constraint Validation

The system enforces the following constraints on ethical pillars:

1. Weight sum must equal 12.0 (tolerance: 1e-10)
2. All pillar symbols must be unique
3. All pillar names must be unique
4. Weight values must be positive real numbers
5. Triad structure must be preserved (4 triads, 3 pillars each)

## Key Management Architecture

### Key Hierarchy

```
                    +------------------+
                    |  Master Secret   |
                    |  (256 bits)      |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
              +--------------+--------------+
              |              |              |
              v              v              v
        +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+
        | HMAC Key  |  | Ed25519   |  | ML-DSA-65 |
        | (derived) |  | Seed      |  | Seed      |
        +-----------+  | (derived) |  | (derived) |
                       +-----+-----+  +-----+-----+
                             |              |
                             v              v
                       +-----------+  +-----------+
                       | Ed25519   |  | ML-DSA-65 |
                       | Key Pair  |  | Key Pair  |
                       +-----------+  +-----------+
```

### Key Derivation

All keys are derived from the master secret using HKDF-SHA3-256 with domain-separated info parameters:

```
hmac_key = HKDF(master_secret, info="ava-guardian-hmac-key-v1")
ed25519_seed = HKDF(master_secret, info="ava-guardian-ed25519-seed-v1")
dilithium_seed = HKDF(master_secret, info="ava-guardian-dilithium-seed-v1")
```

### Key Rotation

The system supports configurable key rotation schedules:

| Schedule | Rotation Interval | Use Case |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| Monthly | 30 days | High-security environments |
| Quarterly | 90 days | Standard production (default) |
| Annually | 365 days | Low-risk applications |

Key rotation procedure:
1. Generate new master secret from CSPRNG
2. Derive new key hierarchy
3. Archive old public keys with timestamp
4. Securely zero old master secret
5. Update active key identifier
6. Log rotation event for audit

### HSM Integration Points

The architecture supports optional HSM integration for master secret storage:

- AWS CloudHSM (FIPS 140-2 Level 3)
- YubiKey PIV (FIPS 140-2 Level 2)
- Nitrokey HSM (Common Criteria EAL4+)
- Generic PKCS#11 interface

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

**In-Scope Threats**:
- Quantum computer attacks on classical signatures (Shor's algorithm)
- Classical cryptanalytic attacks on hash functions and signatures
- Data tampering and forgery attempts
- Key compromise through side-channel attacks
- Replay attacks on signed packages

**Out-of-Scope Threats**:
- Physical access to execution environment
- Compromise of trusted timestamp authorities
- Denial of service attacks
- Social engineering attacks
- Implementation bugs in underlying cryptographic libraries

### Security Properties

| Property | Mechanism | Assurance Level |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Integrity | SHA3-256 + HMAC | 128-bit |
| Authenticity | Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 | 128-bit classical, 192-bit quantum |
| Non-repudiation | Digital signatures + RFC 3161 | Cryptographic proof |
| Forward secrecy | Key rotation | Configurable interval |
| Ethical binding | HKDF context integration | Cryptographic binding |

### Combined Security Analysis

The combined attack cost for breaking all six layers:

**Classical Attack Cost**: 2^724 operations (sum of individual layer costs)
**Quantum Attack Cost**: 2^644 operations (limited by Grover's algorithm bounds)

These values represent upper bounds assuming independent layers. Actual security may be higher due to the requirement to break all layers simultaneously.

### Security Assumptions

The security analysis assumes:

1. SHA3-256 behaves as a random oracle
2. HMAC-SHA3-256 is a secure PRF (widely believed, not formally proven for sponge constructions)
3. Ed25519 discrete log problem is hard for classical computers
4. ML-DSA-65 lattice problems are hard for quantum computers
5. CSPRNG provides uniformly random output
6. Constant-time implementations prevent timing attacks
