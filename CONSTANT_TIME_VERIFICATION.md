This document describes the constant-time verification methodology and tooling for AMA Cryptography's cryptographic implementations.

## Overview

Constant-time implementations are critical for preventing timing side-channel attacks. AMA Cryptography employs a defense-in-depth approach to constant-time security:

1. **C Layer**: Custom constant-time utilities in `src/c/ama_consttime.c` (C11 atomics for thread safety)
2. **Python Layer**: `secure_memory.constant_time_compare()`, which calls AMA's
   own `ama_consttime_memcmp` through ctypes (INVARIANT-1: no third-party
   crypto) and **raises `RuntimeError` when that backend is unavailable**
   rather than substituting anything. It previously fell back to a padded
   pure-Python XOR accumulator, described here as constant-time. INVARIANT-7
   names that substitution as unacceptable for a secret-dependent operation,
   and INVARIANT-12 counts "pre-verification MAC/tag comparisons" as exactly
   that — the callers are HMAC tag verification and pinned-key comparison. The
   loop was not constant-time in fact either, only in shape: `ljust`
   allocates, `zip` builds tuples, and `|=` runs CPython's integer path with
   its small-int cache. A fallback documented as constant-time and not being
   so is worse than none, because callers stop asking.
3. **Native PQC Layer**: All PQC implementations (ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-1024, SLH-DSA) use constant-time primitives internally
4. **Ed25519 Layer**: one in-house implementation on every platform
   (`src/c/ama_ed25519.c` + `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_ge.h`): static
   precomputed base-point tables, constant-time masked table selection,
   constant-time safegcd inversion, no lazy initialisation and no atomics
   on the path (see "Native Ed25519")

## Constant-Time Implementations

### C Utilities (`src/c/ama_consttime.c`)

All 5 constant-time functions are implemented and verified:

| Function | Purpose | Implementation | dudect Verified |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| `ama_consttime_memcmp()` | Byte array comparison | XOR accumulation without early exit | Yes |
| `ama_secure_memzero()` | Secure memory clearing | Volatile pointer to prevent optimization | Yes |
| `ama_consttime_swap()` | Conditional buffer swap | Bitwise masking based on condition | Yes |
| `ama_consttime_lookup()` | Table lookup | Full table scan with conditional copy | Yes |
| `ama_consttime_copy()` | Conditional copy | Bitwise masking based on condition | Yes |

### Python Utilities (`ama_cryptography/secure_memory.py`)

Every secret comparison in the Python layer goes through
`constant_time_compare()`, which calls AMA's own C primitive:

```python
def constant_time_compare(a: bytes, b: bytes) -> bool:
    # ama_consttime_memcmp from the native library, or RuntimeError.
    # There is no fallback: see item 2 above.
    #
    # min(len(a), len(b)) bytes are compared in place — no padding, no
    # allocation — and the length difference is OR-ed into the verdict
    # rather than short-circuiting the content scan.  The scan itself
    # never short-circuits: ama_consttime_memcmp accumulates over all n
    # bytes.
```

**Why the cost is bounded by the *shorter* operand, and why that is not a
weakening.** Through 4.0.0 both operands were padded to
`max(len(a), len(b))` with `ljust`, on the reasoning that a fixed comparison
length hides the lengths. It does not need to: the values AMA compares in
constant time — HMAC-SHA3-256 tags, Ed25519 / ML-DSA-65 public keys, ML-KEM
shared secrets — each have exactly one length fixed by their specification, so
an observer learns nothing from a comparison whose cost depends on them. What
the padding did do was let an *attacker* set that cost. Every call site
compares a locally computed value against one that arrived from outside:
`verify_crypto_package` recomputes a 32-byte tag and compares it against
`package.hmac_tag`, so a package declaring an 8 MiB tag caused 16 MiB of
allocation and an 8 MiB scan before any check had established the package was
worth looking at. Bounding the work by the shorter operand removes that, and
removes it independently of argument order, while leaving every return value
and the content-scan property exactly as they were.

`secure_memory.lengths_match()` is the public length pre-check to run first
where the expected size is known: it refuses a malformed value *as malformed*,
rather than folding a structural defect into a cryptographic verdict.

## Verification Methodology

### dudect-Style Timing Analysis

We provide a dudect-style timing analysis harness based on the methodology from:

> Reparaz, O., Balasch, J., & Verbauwhede, I. (2017).
> "Dude, is my code constant time?"
> https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1123.pdf

The harness uses Welch's t-test to compare execution times between two input classes, with the percentile cropping the paper specifies in §3.3: the pooled samples are cut at a ladder of 20 thresholds and the reported statistic is the signed t of largest magnitude over those rungs and the uncropped one. Cropping is what lets the test see a systematic shift in the *bulk* of the distribution rather than losing it under the heavy right tail that preemption and frequency changes produce; measured against a textbook early-exit `memcmp` at 50,000 iterations, the cropped statistic detected the leak 48 times out of 48 where a single raw Welch t detected it 19 times.

A t-value below `DUDECT_T_THRESHOLD` suggests no detectable timing leakage at the 99.999% confidence level. **That threshold is 5.0, not the 4.5 usually quoted**, because the statistic is a maximum over 21 rungs rather than one t-test, and the maximum of 21 correlated t-values has a wider null distribution: 6,000,000 null replicates put E|t| at 1.618 and sd at 1.717, against 0.798 and 1.000 for a single t. Under that null `P(|t| >= 4.5)` is 7.2e-5 — seven times the 1e-5 that "99.999%" asserts — while `P(|t| >= 5.0)` is 6.5e-6. The calibration is re-derived on every run by the harness self-test, which fails if a change to the rung ladder moves the null out of its measured band.

Two properties of the measurement matter as much as the statistic:

- **A verdict needs a majority of rounds.** A lane must exceed the threshold in more than half of the rounds run, with a consistent sign, before the run fails; excursions that disagree about direction are reported as unusable measurements rather than findings. See `tests/c/dudect/dudect_rounds.h`.
- **A verdict needs an effect size, not just a t-value.** |t| grows as sqrt(n), so significance measures how well a difference was *resolved*, not how large it is — and at these measurement counts the statistic resolves well under one CPU cycle. On one CI run the lanes that failed had per-class differences of 0.199, 0.596 and 1.141 ns while lanes that passed had differences of 35, 78 and 53,932 ns: the verdict was tracking precision, not size. A lane therefore fails only if it is significant **and** its difference reaches `DUDECT_MIN_EFFECT_NS` (2 ns) — above every artefact observed on shared runners and below every real mechanism (a mispredicted branch is 7–10 ns, an L1 miss 30–50 ns, an early-exit `memcmp` hundreds). Below that, a wall-clock test on shared hardware cannot separate a source-level leak from data-operand-dependent execution in the CPU (Intel DOITM / ARM PSTATE.DIT); for the calls they target, the deterministic instruction-count gates measure the part of that range that changes the instruction sequence, with a zero-instruction noise floor (a difference living only in operand-dependent latency is measured by neither instrument — see below). Sub-floor excursions are printed with their own `SUB-FLOOR` verdict, never folded into a pass. Because the floor adjudicates on a number the harness supplies, a lane that trips the threshold while reporting a difference of exactly zero is treated as a harness fault rather than a sub-floor pass: the statistic *is* `delta / se`, so that combination cannot come from a measurement — it can only mean the field was never populated, and a lane in that state would be permanently unable to fail a build. Info-only lanes are exempt, since they are classified as noise before the verdict reaches an effect size at all.

- **The floor is a precondition for adjudication, so it is applied before the direction rule rather than after it.** The direction rule's premise is that a real leak keeps a fixed sign; that presupposes the effect is resolvable. Below the floor it is not, and the consequence was observed: `Ascon-AEAD128 encrypt` read 3/3 consistently signed at +0.596 ns on one CI runner and 2+/1− at +0.607 ns on another — same binary, same measurement count, same effect size to within 2%, opposite verdicts (SUB-FLOOR/green vs UNUSABLE/red). A sign-consistency test applied to a quantity whose sign is not reproducible decides nothing.

Re-measured on one host rather than across two, which is the stronger form of the same result: five consecutive runs of the same binary at 100,000 measurements, pinned to one core, on an Intel Xeon @ 2.10GHz. Eleven lanes reported a per-class mean difference under 2 ns in every run. **Ten of the eleven changed sign at least once across those five runs** — `ama_consttime_lookup` read +0.040, +0.014, +0.006, -0.021, +0.056 ns; `Ascon-AEAD128 encrypt` -0.046, +0.024, -0.023, -0.137, -0.040; `HMAC-SHA3-256 verify` +0.262, +0.167, -0.105, -0.033, +0.203. The sign below the floor is not a property of the code, so the floor cannot be lowered here by taking more measurements: it is not a sampling-noise problem that averages away. At or above 2 ns direction disagreement is still `UNUSABLE` and still fails, and the floor sits below every mechanism that produces a different instruction SEQUENCE — a mispredicted branch is 7-10 ns, an L1 miss 30-50 ns, one extra AES round about 4 ns, an early-exit memcmp hundreds.

What is genuinely given up, stated because it was previously written as "no sensitivity is lost": a secret-dependent difference below 2 ns that comes from operand-dependent instruction LATENCY rather than from a different instruction sequence is measured by NEITHER instrument here. The wall-clock t-test cannot resolve it — see the measurement below — and the callgrind gates count retired instructions, which are identical when only the latency differs. This project's primitives are written to avoid data-dependent instruction selection, which is the class both instruments do cover; the latency class is out of reach of the apparatus as built, and saying otherwise would be the opposite of what this document is for. A sub-floor excursion whose signs disagreed says so in the report rather than being printed identically to a consistently-signed one.

- **The sub-floor exemption's claim is now true for the lanes that reach it.** It says the deterministic instruction-count gates own the sequence-visible part of the range below 2 ns. For two of the lanes observed reaching it, they did not: nothing covered `ama_ascon_aead128_encrypt`, and nothing covered `ama_agent_binding_check`. Both are now covered rather than the claim softened — Ascon-AEAD128 encryption retires 32,069,814 instructions identically across all eight key classes, and the agent binding check 612,810,230 identically whether it accepts or rejects; cross-class delta 0 and noise floor 0 in both cases. The same gap recurred for the constant-time utility primitives, whose strict lanes spend their lives below the floor — the five-run re-measurement above read `ama_consttime_lookup` between −0.021 and +0.056 ns in all five runs, and no deterministic target stood behind that abstention. The `consttime-lookup`, `consttime-swap`, `consttime-copy` and `secure-memzero` targets close it the same way: byte-identical across all eight classes on all four metrics under gcc 13 and clang 18 (lookup 99,715,167 / 99,730,903 instruction references respectively; swap 98,548,267 / 98,584,191; copy 65,782,267 / 65,818,191; memzero 12,529,232 / 19,761,950), same-class floor 0, and each gate verified to fail on a planted condition branch or scan truncation before it was trusted. The strict lanes that remain wall-clock-only are `Argon2id legacy verify`, whose adjudicable component — the tag compare — is `ama_consttime_memcmp` and is covered at primitive level by the `consttime` target, and the two `FROST scalar_negate` lanes, whose branchless borrow loop contains no data-dependent instruction selection to count; both statements are checked against the lane inventory in `tests/c/test_dudect.c` rather than assumed.

- **Where a deterministic gate covers a lane, that gate is the blocking authority and the wall-clock lane is informational.** `Kyber-1024 decaps` read |t| = 11.81 in 3/3 rounds at **+5.630 ns** — above the floor, in mispredicted-branch range, and on the FIPS 203 §6.3 implicit-rejection path, where a timing difference is the plaintext-checking oracle the Fujisaki–Okamoto transform exists to deny. It was treated as real until measurement said otherwise. Over 60 decapsulations per class the `kyber-decaps` target reports, on the Release (-O3) library the wheel ships and with the simulated cache geometry pinned, retired instructions, data references, D1 misses and LLd misses all four identical between the valid and the rejected ciphertext, under gcc 13 and clang 18 alike (the absolute figures for the measuring commit are in `CHANGELOG.md`; the zero deltas are the invariant). Instructions rule out a branch or skipped work; the data-reference and miss figures rule out a secret-dependent access, which instruction counts alone cannot see. (An earlier revision of this bullet argued from the excursion being "one part in 90,000" of a decapsulation; that ratio was computed from an unoptimized build, and the argument does not hold at any denominator, because a mispredicted branch costs a fixed 5–20 ns however long the surrounding operation is. The deterministic identity is the evidence.) The wall-clock lane is therefore INFO and `kyber-decaps` blocks — a strictly more sensitive instrument for the property that matters, resolving a single instruction where the lane cannot resolve 2 ns. This is the pairing `secp256k1 ECDSA sign` already uses with `ecdsa`. **Where the excursion came from is now measured rather than inferred:** the lane selected its ciphertext with a class-correlated ternary sitting between the class draw and the opening timer, and on a null experiment — byte-identical ciphertexts in both classes, so the true effect is exactly zero, 200,000 measurements x 5 runs — that construction reads over threshold in 3 of 5 runs at worst |t| = 6.99 with every excursion the same sign, while the masked-merge staging the lane now uses reads 0 of 5. An earlier revision of this bullet attributed the residual to data-operand-dependent execution (Intel DOITM / ARM PSTATE.DIT); that inference is withdrawn as unnecessary. The deterministic identity is unchanged and is what settles the primitive.

- **The absolute floor is calibrated for short primitives.** 2 ns is the right scale for operations of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, where a mechanism's cost is a large fraction of the whole. It is not the right scale for an operation four orders of magnitude longer, which accumulates many tiny operand-dependent effects that no mechanism produced. Rather than scale the floor — which would risk hiding a real branch inside a long operation — the long-running lanes are given deterministic coverage, which has no such trade-off.
- **Both classes are staged through one buffer.** Cropping resolves the bulk of the distribution, which at these sample counts means a standard error near 0.04 ns — finer than one CPU cycle. At that resolution the *address* of a lane's input is a confounder: with identical data in both classes, placing one class's key across two cache lines drives |t| to 13.5–30.9 with a consistent sign, which is what a leak looks like and is not one. Every lane therefore copies the selected class's input into a single cache-line-aligned buffer before the timed region, so the classes differ in data and not in address.

Each lane also reports the per-class mean difference in nanoseconds beside its t-value, because |t| alone does not distinguish a 0.2 ns measurement artefact from an exploitable difference.

- **The SVE2 dispatch slots have no constant-time measurement, on any commit.** The nightly SIMD sweep carries `kyber-sve2` and `sha3-sve2` cells, and the SVE2 kernels are in the build those cells run (`-DAMA_ENABLE_SVE2=ON`) — but the hosted AArch64 runners' silicon lacks SVE2, so the measurement step exits 77 (Skipped) on every recorded run while the surrounding job reports success; the exit-77 audit trail in `dudect.yml` is the record of that. The functional correctness of the SVE2 kernels is verified under QEMU at two vector lengths on pull requests that touch the native tree (`arm-qemu.yml`); their timing behaviour is verified nowhere, because QEMU timing is not silicon timing and the deterministic instruction-count gates run on x86-64. Reading a green sweep as SVE2 constant-time coverage would be false confidence; that verification requires SVE2 hardware.

- **The AVX-512 SHA-3 slot has no constant-time measurement either.** `sha3-avx512x4` sits alongside the two SVE2 cells in the sweep's `OPTIONAL_SLOTS` list (`dudect.yml`), so a 77 from it emits a `::warning::` and the job still exits 0. Unlike SVE2, whether it is measured at all is decided by runner-pool luck rather than by a fixed hardware fact: AVX-512 is present on some hosted x86-64 runner SKUs and absent on others, so the same commit can be measured on one run and silently unmeasured on the next, with nothing in the record distinguishing the two. What bounds the exposure is that the kernel is not in anything this project ships: `AMA_ENABLE_AVX512` defaults to `OFF` (`CMakeLists.txt`), and `setup.py` never sets it, so no released wheel contains the AVX-512 kernel — it reaches a user only through a deliberate source build with the flag turned on. Its *functional* correctness is verified on every relevant pull request under Intel SDE (`ci.yml`, byte-identity against the scalar and AVX2 paths); its timing behaviour is not verified anywhere.

- **~~Three NEON slots are not measurable at all, because the dispatch names do not exist.~~ Closed.** The NEON ML-KEM NTT, ML-DSA NTT and Argon2-G kernels ship in every AArch64 build and every arm64 wheel, and had no timing measurement on any commit — not because the silicon was unavailable, but because `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY_SLOTS` in `src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c` carried no name that resolved to them, so the sweep could not pin them even in principle. `kyber-ntt-neon`, `dilithium-ntt-neon` and `argon2-g-neon` now exist and are **mandatory** cells of the nightly sweep on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` — not optional, because AdvSIMD is architecturally guaranteed on AArch64, so a 77 from one of them is a dispatch-wiring regression rather than a hardware fact, and `dudect.yml`'s confirm step fails the lane on it. They resolve the way `sha3-neon` does rather than the way the AVX2 and SVE2 branches do: on an SVE2 build running on SVE2 silicon the higher tier has already overwritten `kyber_ntt` and `dilithium_ntt`, so a `saved ==` comparison would answer UNSUPPORTED and blame the CPU, which is the defect recorded above for `sha3-neon`. Verified under QEMU at the commit that added them: all three resolve HONORED (`ama_dispatch_active_slot()` returns the requested label), `test_kat` passes under each pin, the AArch64 C suite goes 68/68 → 71/71, and on x86-64 the same three names report UNSUPPORTED (exit 77) rather than UNRECOGNISED.

  Remaining after this: the two SVE2 cells and `sha3-avx512x4` above, both of which are genuine hardware-availability limits rather than missing wiring.

```

### Interpreting Results

| t-value | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| \|t\| < 5.0 | No detectable timing leakage (PASS) |
| 5.0 <= \|t\| < 10 | Over threshold: a finding only if it reproduces in a majority of rounds with a consistent sign **and** the per-class mean difference is at least 2 ns |
| \|t\| >= 10 | Over threshold, same three conditions |

The magnitude condition is not a footnote to the first two, and this table
used to omit it — which made the row above say that a sign-consistent
majority is a finding, seventy lines after the paragraph that explains why it
is not.  A majority of rounds over the threshold, consistently signed, with a
mean difference under 2 ns is `SUB-FLOOR`: it is reported, and it does not
fail the build.  Nor does a large \|t\| on its own — the statistic grows as
sqrt(n), so at 100,000 measurements it crosses 5.0 on differences far below
one CPU cycle.

Read the reported per-class mean difference alongside the t-value. |t| grows
as sqrt(n) for any non-zero difference, so at high measurement counts the
statistic reaches the threshold on differences far below one CPU cycle, and
the difference in nanoseconds is what says whether a finding is exploitable.
A real leak mechanism — a mispredicted branch, an extra cache line, an extra
round — costs nanoseconds to tens of nanoseconds; a lane reporting |t| over
the threshold on a difference of 0.2 ns is measuring the harness or the host,
not the primitive.

**Note**: Environmental factors such as CPU frequency scaling, interrupts, and cache effects can cause false positives. The multi-round majority rule exists for exactly this and handles excursions that vary between rounds; it does **not** handle a bias that is fixed for a given binary and host, which reproduces every round with the same sign. That class is removed by construction instead — see the staging discipline below. Run the test multiple times and consider disabling CPU frequency scaling for more accurate results.

### Harness Setup-Symmetry Discipline

Two lanes in `tests/c/test_dudect.c` (`test_consttime_memcmp` and
`test_frost_scalar_negate_midrange`) were hardened in v3.2.0 against a
false-positive class identified on noisy CI runners.  The underlying
primitives (`ama_consttime_memcmp` and FROST `scalar_negate`) are
byte-by-byte branchless in source, but the harnesses fed them inputs
through asymmetric setup paths — class 1 in `test_consttime_memcmp`
made an extra `rand()` call and one extra branch-conditional write
before the timer started, and `test_frost_scalar_negate_midrange`
served class-0 inputs from a stack array while class-1 came from
`.rodata`.  The pre-timer asymmetries (branch-predictor state, cache
line provenance, libc call frequency) bled into the timed window and
surfaced as ~+12σ and ~−6σ false-positive readings respectively.

The post-fix pattern, codified at the top of each lane in
`tests/c/test_dudect.c`:

1. Perform identical setup work for both classes (same `rand()`
   draws, same memcpy count, same conditional writes — driven by an
   index that is independent of `class_idx`).
2. Stage every reference input into the same memory class (typically
   the local stack frame) so the kernel reads them through equivalent
   cache paths.
3. Choose the class OUTSIDE the timing region.  The timed window
   contains exactly one call with no class-correlated control flow.

**Point 3 was necessary and not sufficient, and the missing half is now
point 4.** Selecting a *pointer* outside the timer still leaves the two
classes reading two different addresses inside it, and an address is
something a load's timing legitimately depends on: which cache line it
falls in, whether it spans two, which set it maps to.  Unlike scheduler
noise, that difference is fixed for a given binary on a given host, so it
reproduces in every round with the same sign — the shape the multi-round
majority rule is specifically unable to distinguish from a leak.

Measured with the Ascon-AEAD128-encrypt lane's own cipher call and
**identical key data in both classes**, so the true effect is exactly zero:
placing class 0's key across two cache lines while class 1's sits inside one
drives the cropped statistic to |t| = 13.5–30.9, over threshold in 10 of 10
runs, all one sign.  Staged through a single buffer, the same measurement
reports 0 of 10.  This became reachable when the harnesses adopted percentile
cropping: cropping resolves the bulk of the distribution, which for that lane
means a bulk standard deviation of about 4 ns over ~22,000 samples per class,
a standard error near 0.04 ns, and a threshold crossed by a systematic
difference of roughly 0.2 ns — under half a cycle at 2.1 GHz.

4. Copy the selected class's input into ONE shared, cache-line-aligned
   buffer, and hand the timed call that buffer.  Both classes then present
   the same address and the same alignment, and only the data differs.  The
   copy is identical work for both classes and happens outside the timed
   region.  `dudect_stage_select(dst, src0, src1, len, class_idx)` in
   `tests/c/dudect/dudect_stage.h` is the helper; it is used by every lane
   that feeds a buffer to the timed call, in `tests/c/test_dudect.c` and by
   the keyed lanes in `tools/constant_time/dudect_crypto.c`.

   These two lines used to name `dudect_stage()` in `dudect.h`.  No such
   symbol exists, and the three-argument `dudect_stage(dst, src, len)` shape
   they described is the construction this file's own headers document as
   UNSAFE: copying only the selected class's bytes makes the SOURCE address
   class-correlated, which is the leak the staging exists to remove.  The
   five-argument form reads both sources every iteration and merges them
   under a constant-time mask; `tools/check_dudect_class_staging.py` refuses
   the one-source form outright.

Sensitivity is untouched by point 4: a data-dependent leak follows the data,
which still differs by class.  For compare-style primitives the equivalent —
and stronger — form is a single reused probe whose bytes are rewritten
class-symmetrically each iteration, which is what the AES-GCM and Ascon
tag-compare lanes use.

Future dudect lanes should follow all four points.

## ctgrind/Valgrind Verification

For more rigorous verification, you can use ctgrind (constant-time grind) with Valgrind:

### Installation

```bash
# Install Valgrind
sudo apt-get install valgrind

# Clone ctgrind (optional, for ct_poison/ct_unpoison macros)
git clone https://github.com/agl/ctgrind.git
```

### Running ctgrind Analysis

```bash
cd tools/constant_time
make

# Run under Valgrind with memcheck
valgrind --tool=memcheck --track-origins=yes ./dudect_harness 10000

# For more detailed analysis, use cachegrind
valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./dudect_harness 10000
```

### Expected Valgrind Output

A clean run should show:
- No memory errors
- No uninitialized value usage
- Consistent cache behavior across input classes

## Upstream Library Guarantees

### Native PQC (ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-1024, SLH-DSA-256f)

The native C implementations provide constant-time operations:

- All NTT and polynomial arithmetic use constant-time primitives
- No secret-dependent branches or memory accesses **inside a primitive** —
  see *Rejection sampling and what these gates cannot cover* immediately
  below for the one place this does not extend to, which is the signing
  loop the standards themselves define as variable-iteration
- Validated through NIST KAT (Known Answer Test) vectors (FIPS 203/204/205)
- Rejection sampling uses constant-time comparisons

#### Rejection sampling and what these gates cannot cover

The bullet above used to read "No secret-dependent branches or memory
accesses", unqualified, for all three PQC algorithms. This repository's own
dudect lane falsifies that for ML-DSA-65 signing, and has for as long as the
lane has existed: at 100,000 measurements against two constant messages under
one key, `ML-DSA-65 sign` reads **t = -815.72** at a per-class difference of
**-48.7 us**. That is five orders of magnitude above the harness's 2 ns
effect-size floor. Recording the unqualified claim beside a measurement that
contradicts it is the documentation failure INVARIANT-16 exists to prevent, so
the claim is narrowed to what the code delivers.

**What is true.** FIPS 204 Algorithm 2 signs inside a rejection loop.
`dil_sign_internal` (`src/c/ama_dilithium.c`) restarts on three norm checks —
`||z||`, `||w0 - c*s2||`, `||c*t0||` — and on the hint-weight check, and every
one of those predicates is a function of the secret vectors `s1`, `s2`, `t0`
and of the message. Both the number of attempts and the point at which an
attempt aborts are therefore secret-dependent control flow, **by the
standard's construction** and identically to the pq-crystals reference
implementation. SLH-DSA's WOTS+ chain lengths depend on the message digest,
which depends on the secret PRF key through the randomiser `R`, in the same
way. Neither is an AMA defect; both are properties of the algorithms as
standardised.

**What follows for the gates.** A deterministic zero-delta instruction count
is not merely absent for these two primitives, it is *impossible*: the code
does a different amount of work by design, so a target that demanded equality
would fail on a correct implementation. `ML-DSA-65 sign` and
`SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f sign` are consequently the only two info-only wall-clock
lanes in `tests/c/test_dudect.c` whose blocking counterpart in
`tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py` is IMPOSSIBLE rather than unwanted, and
that is stated rather than left to be inferred from a flag.  There are three
such lanes without a counterpart: the table below lists `Ed25519 verify` as
the third, with "**none, and none is wanted**" — a different reason, and the
sentence used to say "the only two ... with no blocking counterpart", which
the table it introduces contradicts five lines later.

`tests/c/test_dudect.c` registers **eight** info-only lanes, and here is every
one of them with its counterpart, because a paragraph that lists some of them
reads as listing all of them:

| Info-only lane | Blocking counterpart |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `Kyber-1024 decaps` | `--target kyber-decaps` |
| `secp256k1 ECDSA sign (RFC 6979)` | `--target ecdsa` |
| `secp256k1 scalar multiplication` | `--target secp256k1-scalarmult` |
| `X25519 scalarmult` | `--target x25519` |
| `X25519 scalarmult batch x4` | `--target x25519-batch` |
| `Ed25519 verify` | **none, and none is wanted** — verification is
  variable-time by design (RFC 8032 §5.1.7 operates on the signature and the
  public key, both public), so a target demanding equality would be asserting
  a property the algorithm does not claim |
| `ML-DSA-65 sign` | **none possible** — see above |
| `SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f sign` | **none possible** — see above |

An earlier version of this paragraph named six of the eight and asserted that
`X25519 scalarmult batch x4` was "the third lane with no counterpart, and the
only one of the three where a counterpart was possible". It omitted
`Ed25519 verify` and `secp256k1 scalar multiplication` entirely. The second of
those was a real gap rather than a documentation one: the lane's own source
comment claimed "fail-loud variants of this lane are intentionally surfaced
separately via `tests/c/test_consttime.c`", and that file contains no
secp256k1 scalar-multiplication case — so a 256-step Montgomery ladder over a
secret scalar was covered only by a lane that cannot fail CI. `--target
secp256k1-scalarmult` closes it: the same ladder, the same Hamming-weight class
contrast the dudect lane uses (k = 1 against a scalar just under n, so every
ladder step takes the opposite `cswap` branch), measured at limit 0 on all four
metrics — I refs 16,020,324 and D refs 3,835,722 byte-identical across all
eight classes, D1 and LL misses identical too.

That measurement took two attempts, which is worth recording. The first driver
selected between two constant arrays with `k = (cls & 1) ? k_high : k_low`, and
the miss columns split exactly along the odd/even classes at 1,661 vs 1,660
while instruction and data-reference counts were already identical. The
library was not leaking; the *driver* was, by handing the ladder a different
address per class. Staging the scalar into one aligned buffer with a branchless
select — the same thing `dudect_stage_select` does in `tests/c/test_dudect.c` —
took all four columns to zero.

**What remains covered for ML-DSA and SLH-DSA.** Every primitive the loop
calls — NTT, pointwise Montgomery multiplication, the norm checks, SHAKE — is
branch-free on its own operands; the FIPS 203/204/205 KAT suites pin
functional correctness; `tools/check_secret_division.py` proves no divide
instruction in the linked object stands on a secret operand; and
`tools/check_c_secret_zeroization.py` pins the scrubbing of every per-attempt
intermediate, including the sponge contexts `dil_polyvec_uniform_eta` and
`dil_polyvecl_uniform_gamma1` leave holding `rhoprime`.

**What is not claimed.** That the attempt count leaks nothing. It correlates
with the norm distribution of the secret vectors. The standard accepts this
for the ML-DSA parameter sets and AMA claims no more than the standard does.

### Native Ed25519

**Which backend you are reading about.** The tree ships exactly one Ed25519
implementation, entirely in-house, and every platform builds it:
`src/c/ama_ed25519.c` (the RFC 8032 protocol, scalar arithmetic mod `l`, digit
recoding and the public API) plus the group-arithmetic template
`src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_ge.h`, instantiated twice from the same source
text — over the radix-2⁵¹ **fe51** field, the default on every platform, and,
on x86-64 GCC/Clang builds only, over the radix-2⁶⁴ MULX+ADX kernel
(`src/c/x86/ama_ed25519_fe64_mulx.c`). The second instantiation is
byte-identical to the first (`tests/c/test_ed25519_fe51_mulx_equiv.c`) and is
reached only through `ama_ed25519_set_mulx_override(1)`; it is not the default
because it measured slower at the group level. `nm` on any built library finds
the `_fe51` symbols, and on x86-64 GCC/Clang their `_mulx` twins beside them.
MSVC builds the fe51 arithmetic through a 128-bit accumulator on `_umul128` /
`__shiftright128` (x64) or `__umulh` (ARM64), so Windows needs no other
backend.

Until the twenty-first maintenance pass this was not so. The x86-64 default was
a vendored public-domain assembly backend that *replaced* `ama_ed25519.c` in
the source list, so every x86-64 CI lane and wheel shipped a file this document
did not analyse, and a CI differential job held it and `ama_ed25519.c` to
behavioural equivalence. The vendored tree, its shim, its CMake option, its
sanitizer define, the parity tool and the differential job are all gone (see
CHANGELOG). What survives is its recorded behaviour:
`tests/oracle/ed25519_frozen_oracle.txt`, 2,022 records taken from the removed
backend at commit `e848740` and replayed against the in-house implementation
by `tests/c/test_ed25519_frozen_oracle.c` and
`tests/test_ed25519_frozen_oracle.py`, so the accept/reject set — the two
compressed-point decode rules (INVARIANT-38) included — is pinned to what
shipped before.

Two consequences worth stating rather than leaving implied:

- There is no runtime initialisation on the Ed25519 path to guard. The
  base-point tables are `static const` (`src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_tables.h`,
  generated by `tools/gen_ed25519_tables.py`) and no function on the path
  writes file-scope state: no lazy initialisation, no atomics, on any
  platform. Earlier revisions of this section described a C11 `_Atomic`
  initialisation guard; it went with the lazily built table it protected.
- The analysis below is the analysis of the shipping code on every platform,
  x86-64 included, in both radices: the comb, the table selection and the sign
  application are one source text, and only the field multiply beneath them
  differs between the two instantiations.

> **Sanitizer coverage (audit M21).** Earlier revisions carried a caveat here:
> under `AMA_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON` a define routed the formerly vendored
> backend around its inline-assembly table selection, so the sanitizer lanes
> exercised a path the x86-64 wheels did not ship. That backend and that define

#### The fe51 backend (`src/c/ama_ed25519.c`, every platform)

The native C Ed25519 implementation provides constant-time operations:

- Constant-time base-point scalar multiplication for keygen and signing: a
  signed 5-bit-window comb over 26 static tables of 16 affine Niels entries,
  with a fixed digit count and a table selection that reads every entry of the
  row and combines with masks (a 128-bit SSE2 fold in the template, or the
  256-bit AVX2 fold in `src/c/avx2/ama_ed25519_select_avx2.c` dispatched on
  CPUID), so the access trace is independent of the secret scalar; the digit
  sign is applied by masked swap and masked negate. (Not a Montgomery ladder —
  this file previously said "Montgomery ladder", which named an algorithm
  `ama_ed25519.c` has never contained and sent an auditor looking for the wrong
  construct.)
- Verification uses half-size scalar decomposition (Antipa et al.,
  `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_halfsize.h`) over precomputed odd multiples of
  `B` and of `2^128 B`, finishing with a projective identity test; it is
  variable-time **by design**, because every scalar on the verify path —
  `H(R,A,M)` — is public.
- No secret-dependent branches or memory accesses on the secret-scalar paths
- Constant-time field inversion by Bernstein–Yang safegcd divsteps
  (`src/c/internal/ama_fe25519_safegcd.h`), a fixed number of branch-free
  steps in place of a Fermat exponentiation chain
- Dedicated field squaring (`fe51_sq()`; the MULX square kernel in the other
  instantiation)
- No lazy initialisation and no atomics anywhere on the path: the base-point
  tables are compile-time constants
- Sign/verify roundtrip validated against RFC 8032 Test Vector 1 (12 tests)

### Native AES-256-GCM (`src/c/ama_aes_gcm.c`)

**Default build is constant-time.** `AMA_AES_CONSTTIME` defaults to `ON`
(`CMakeLists.txt`), which selects the masked full-table-scan S-box in
`src/c/ama_aes_bitsliced.c` — a lookup reads all 256 entries and selects with
an arithmetic mask, so the memory access pattern is uniform and independent of
the secret index.  (The construct is a masked scan, not an algebraic circuit:
both are constant-time, but a side-channel reviewer assesses them differently,
and THREAT_MODEL.md:136 already describes it correctly.)
Hosts with AES-NI / VAES dispatch to the hardware kernels instead, which are
likewise table-free.

**Caveat, and it is now narrow:** building with `-DAMA_AES_CONSTTIME=OFF`
selects the 256-byte table S-box, which is **not** constant-time against
cache-timing side channels in shared-tenant environments. That opt-out is
deliberately awkward — CMake requires an explicit acknowledgement string before
it will configure (INVARIANT-20) — so a build reaches the unsafe path only on
purpose.

*(An earlier revision of this section stated the table S-box unconditionally,
which stopped being true when the bitsliced path became the default. It
understated the library's posture rather than overstating it, but it was still
wrong: a reader could conclude a stock build needed mitigation it already had.)*

**GHASH** is also table-free, and its mask is laundered through
`ama_ct_value_barrier_u64` so an optimizer cannot convert the branch-free
selection back into a branch on the secret subkey — a real regression clang 18
introduced at `-O2`/`-O3`. `tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py` measures
retired instructions across key classes under callgrind and fails on any
key-dependent count; it runs unconditionally in `dudect.yml`.

## Functional Correctness Tests

In addition to timing analysis, we provide functional correctness tests for the constant-time utilities:

```bash
cd tests/c
# Build and run C tests (requires CMake)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./test_consttime
```

These tests verify:
- `ama_consttime_memcmp`: Identical buffers return 0, different buffers return non-zero
- `ama_secure_memzero`: Buffer is completely zeroed
- `ama_consttime_swap`: Buffers are swapped when condition=1, unchanged when condition=0

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Statistical Nature**: Timing analysis is statistical and cannot prove the absence of all timing leaks. It can only detect leaks above a certain threshold.

2. **Environment Sensitivity**: Results depend on the execution environment. Factors like CPU microarchitecture, OS scheduler, and system load can affect measurements.

3. **Compiler Optimizations**: Aggressive compiler optimizations may introduce timing variations. The harness is compiled with `-O2` which balances optimization with predictability.

4. **Scope**: This verification covers the C constant-time utilities. The
   Python layer routes secret comparisons into the same C primitive via
   `secure_memory.constant_time_compare()`, so it inherits that coverage
   rather than relying on an upstream guarantee.

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Run verification on target hardware**: Timing characteristics vary by CPU architecture.

2. **Disable CPU frequency scaling**: For accurate measurements, set CPU governor to "performance":
   ```bash
   sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
   ```

3. **Isolate the test**: Run on an otherwise idle system to minimize interference.

4. **Regular re-verification**: Re-run timing analysis after any changes to cryptographic code paths.

5. **Independent audit**: For high-security deployments, engage a third-party security firm to perform formal constant-time verification.
