# Quick build targets:

#   make c          - Build C library only
#   make python     - Build Python package
#   make test       - Run all tests
#   make clean      - Clean build artifacts
#   make install    - Install library system-wide
#   make docker     - Build Docker image

# EVERY target here is a command, not a file.  `docs`, `docker` and `fuzz` are
# also real directories in this tree, and GNU make treats a target that names an
# existing file with no newer prerequisites as up to date: `make docs` printed
# nothing and ran nothing, silently, including after the recipe was rewritten to
# route sphinx through `$(RUN)`.  The other names are listed for the same
# reason one step earlier — a directory added later must not be able to disable
# a target by existing.

	@# what CI runs. Be clear about the cost: `$$(RUN)` exists to pick the
	@# INTERPRETER's copy of a tool over a console script from some other
