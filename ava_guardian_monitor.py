Ava Guardian ♱ (AG♱): 3R Runtime Anomaly Monitoring System
==========================================================

3R Mechanism: Resonance-Recursion-Refactoring for runtime anomaly monitoring.

The 3R Mechanism is a novel runtime anomaly monitoring framework developed for
Ava Guardian ♱ by Steel Security Advisors LLC. It provides three complementary
approaches to runtime security analysis without compromising cryptographic
integrity or performance.

Key Features:
- High-resolution timing using time.perf_counter_ns() (cross-platform)
- Per-operation baseline statistics (separate stats for each crypto operation)
- EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) for robust anomaly detection
- MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) for outlier-resistant statistics
- Sliding window analysis with configurable retention

Note: This is a runtime ANOMALY MONITORING system, not a timing attack
detection/prevention system. It surfaces statistical anomalies for
security review - it does not guarantee side-channel resistance.
