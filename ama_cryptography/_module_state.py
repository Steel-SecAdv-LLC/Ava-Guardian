FIPS 140-3 module state machine — the error-state leaf (§4.9.2)
===============================================================

The single source of truth for the module's FIPS state (``SELF_TEST`` /
``OPERATIONAL`` / ``ERROR``), the two output-inhibition guards, and the
health-tested CSPRNG draw.

Why this is its own module
--------------------------
Every layer of the library must be able to ask "may cryptographic output
leave this module?" — ``pqc_backends`` and the Cython bindings on the native
surface, ``secure_memory`` on the RNG surface, ``session`` / ``ascon`` /
``key_formats`` / ``agent_binding`` / ``hybrid_combiner`` above them, and
``crypto_api`` at the top.  When these guards lived in ``_self_test`` (the
POST orchestrator), every one of those modules had to import the orchestrator,
while the orchestrator's Known Answer Tests import ``pqc_backends`` to test
the primitives — an import cycle that forced call-time imports
(``session.py``'s mid-file import block, ``secure_memory``'s import inside
``secure_random_bytes``) and was flagged by static analysis on every one of
its edges.

This module is a *leaf*: it imports the standard library and
``ama_cryptography.exceptions`` and nothing else, so anything may import it —
at the top of the file, in any order — and no cycle can form through it.
``_self_test`` keeps orchestrating POST (stages, KATs, results, attestation)
and re-exports these names for backward compatibility, but the state itself
lives here.

The raw state variables are deliberately NOT re-exported by ``_self_test``:
code that rebinds ``_MODULE_STATE`` directly must do so on this module, where
the guards actually read it.  A rebind on a re-exported copy would diverge
from the state the guards enforce and turn a test into a no-op — so the stale
spelling fails loudly (``AttributeError``) instead of passing silently.

# * ``NativeBackendUnavailableError`` — a counterpart operation is not built.
#   An availability gap is a refusal to release the keypair, not evidence

# Everything else (a verify that returns False, a wrong shared secret, a
# nonzero return code, an unexpected crash inside the primitive) is the test
