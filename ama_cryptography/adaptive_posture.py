AMA Cryptography - Adaptive Cryptographic Posture System
============================================================

Consumes 3R monitor output to dynamically evaluate system security posture
and trigger appropriate cryptographic responses: algorithm switching and
key rotation via existing infrastructure.

Architecture:
    3R Monitor → PostureEvaluator → CryptoPostureController → crypto_api.py
                                                            → key_management.py

No new cryptographic logic is introduced. This module orchestrates existing
primitives (multi-algorithm API, BIP32 key derivation, key rotation manager)
based on real-time anomaly signals from the 3R monitoring system.

    Evaluates cryptographic security posture from 3R monitor output.

    Consumes timing anomalies, pattern anomalies, resonance analysis, and
    Lyapunov stability signals from AmaCryptographyMonitor to derive a threat
    level and recommended action. Thresholds are configurable for different
    deployment contexts.

    The evaluator uses a weighted scoring model:

    - Timing anomalies (45%) — severity-weighted scores
    - Pattern anomalies (25%) — z-score magnitude
    - Resonance detection (15%) — resonance ratio
    - Lyapunov stability (15%) — double-helix engine divergence detection

    Threshold calibration:

    Thresholds are set at statistically meaningful sigma levels
    mapped to the [0, 1] composite score range using a Gaussian CDF
    survival function approximation::

        ELEVATED  = 1 - Phi(3)  ≈ 0.0013  → 0.15  (3-sigma anomaly)
        HIGH      = 1 - Phi(5)  ≈ 2.9e-7  → 0.45  (5-sigma anomaly)
        CRITICAL  = 1 - Phi(7)  ≈ 1.3e-12 → 0.80  (7-sigma anomaly)

    These values represent the probability that a score this high arises
    from normal operational variance. The mapping to [0,1] accounts for
    the weighted composite score compression from four signal sources.

        Returns False when the action's rotation half was SUPPRESSED by the
        failure cap or the retry backoff and nothing else in the action ran —
        i.e. when nothing happened.  Callers that report an execution to a
        human (``confirm_action``) or that consume a queued action
        (``_process_expired_pending_actions``) must not treat a suppressed
        rotation as done.

        The two effects an action can have are throttled independently, by
        ``_last_rotation_time`` and ``_last_switch_time``, because they have
        opposite failure modes and one timer cannot serve both:

        * A rotation that was attempted and FAILED (the KMS unreachable,
          ``on_rotation`` raising) must stay retryable, so arming is delegated
          to :meth:`_trigger_rotation`, which arms only when a rotation
          actually happened or there was no mechanism to attempt.  Arming
          unconditionally here, and *before* the attempt, silently defeated
          that and made the whole attempted/succeeded distinction dead code.
        * An algorithm switch must never run back-to-back, so
          :meth:`_trigger_algorithm_switch_if_due` arms its own window whether
          or not anything else in the action succeeded.

        Sharing one timer meant ``ROTATE_AND_SWITCH`` had to pick which
        property to break, and it broke the second: a failing rotation left the
        timer unarmed, the switch rode along un-throttled, and every evaluation
        cycle climbed another rung of the ladder and fired the switch callback
        again — the exact condition the ``SWITCH_ALGORITHM`` branch armed the
        timer to prevent.

        Splitting them also means a switch no longer postpones a due rotation.
        That coupling was incidental to the shared timer, and losing it removes
        a case where escalating the algorithm suppressed the retry of a
        rotation the same threat had demanded.

        exists because ``confirm_action`` reported True and logged "Confirmed
        and executed action" for a suppressed rotation, popping the operator's
        pending action for an execution that did not happen; the guards had no
        way to say so.

        Failed rotations are throttled by their own exponential backoff and
        capped, which is a different thing from the ``rotation_cooldown``
        window a SUCCESSFUL rotation arms.

        Both are needed, and the reason is a measurement.  Arming
        ``_last_rotation_time`` unconditionally in ``_execute_action`` — which
        is what this class did before — made the whole attempted/succeeded
        distinction dead code and suppressed every retry of a rotation that
        had never happened.  Deleting that line fixed the dead code and
        removed the only throttle a FAILING rotation had: over 20 evaluation
        cycles at sustained CRITICAL, a raising ``on_rotation`` callback was
        invoked 20 times, ``_rotation_count`` reached 20, the cooldown was
        never armed, and with a caller-supplied KMS-backed manager whose
        ``initiate_rotation`` raises, 20 fresh ``posture-rotation-N`` keys
        were registered — one per cycle, unbounded in the evaluation rate.
        (The same run with a rotation that succeeds: 1 invocation, cooldown
        armed.)

        So: retryable, but not free.  Each consecutive failure doubles the
        wait (see ``_rotation_retry_delay``), and after
        ``MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ROTATION_FAILURES`` the controller stops attempting
        and says so at CRITICAL.  Continuing to hammer a rotation mechanism
        that has failed six times with growing backoff does not rotate
        anything; it burns key identifiers and derivation indices, floods the
        callback, and buries the operator's evidence.

        A rotation that SUCCEEDS clears the streak, so a mechanism that comes
        back resumes immediately — WHILE THE CONTROLLER IS STILL ATTEMPTING.
        Once the cap is reached there is no next success to have: the guard
        below returns before ``get_active_key`` or ``on_rotation`` is touched,
        and the streak is only cleared downstream of it.  ``reset()`` is
        therefore the sole exit from the suspended state, which is what the
        CRITICAL log says and what this docstring used to imply otherwise.

        ``get_posture_summary()`` reports ``rotation_failure_streak`` and
