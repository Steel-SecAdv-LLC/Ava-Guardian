AMA Cryptography Secure Memory Module
=====================================

Provides secure memory operations for cryptographic applications
requiring memory protection.  This module is dependency-free and uses
only the Python standard library.

Features:

- Secure zeroing — multi-pass overwrite implementation
- Constant-time comparison — AMA's native C library, and nothing else: the
  pure-Python XOR accumulator this module used to fall back to was not
  constant-time in fact (INVARIANT-7), so ``constant_time_compare`` now raises
  rather than substituting it
- SecureBuffer context manager — automatic cleanup on exit
- Secure random byte generation — routed through the FIPS 140-3 §4.9.2
  output-inhibited, health-tested CSPRNG (no longer a bare ``os.urandom``)

Implementation notes:

- ``secure_memzero``: Multi-pass byte-level overwrite
- ``secure_mlock`` / ``secure_munlock``: Native C backend (VirtualLock/mlock) or POSIX fallback
- ``constant_time_compare``: ``ama_consttime_memcmp`` (C), required — raises
  ``RuntimeError`` when the native library is absent
- ``lengths_match``: public (non-constant-time) length pre-check, for use
  before ``constant_time_compare`` where the expected size is fixed
- ``secure_random_bytes``: routed through ``_self_test.secure_token_bytes`` —
  the error-state-gated, continuous-health-tested draw (not bare ``os.urandom``)

Usage::

    from ama_cryptography.secure_memory import (
        SecureBuffer,
        secure_memzero,
        constant_time_compare,
    )

    # Using SecureBuffer context manager (recommended)
    with SecureBuffer(32) as buf:
        buf[:] = secret_key_bytes
        # ... use buffer ...
    # Buffer automatically zeroed on exit

    # Manual operations
    secret = bytearray(b"sensitive data")
    secure_memzero(secret)  # Securely wipe (multi-pass)

    ``len()`` on a memoryview counts ITEMS, not bytes.  For the byte-format
    views this module is usually handed the two agree, and for a ``bytearray``
    they always do — which is exactly why the difference went unnoticed.  On a
    view whose ``itemsize`` is greater than one they diverge by that factor,
    and every native back-end here sized its wipe with ``len()``:

        buf = (ctypes.c_char * length).from_buffer(data)

    ``from_buffer`` accepts a length SMALLER than the buffer, so nothing
    raised.  Measured on ``memoryview(array('I', [0xDEADBEEF] * 8))`` — 8
    items, 32 bytes — ``secure_memzero`` zeroed 8 bytes, returned normally, and
    left **24 of 32 secret bytes intact**.  A wipe that reports success while
    three quarters of the secret survives is worse than no wipe at all, because
    the caller stops worrying (INVARIANT-6).

    ``secure_mlock``/``secure_munlock`` had the same defect with a different
    consequence: locking ``len()`` bytes of a wider buffer leaves the remaining
    pages swappable, so secret material could still reach disk.

    Non-contiguous views are refused rather than mis-wiped.  A strided view's
    bytes are not the ``nbytes`` bytes starting at its address, so any
    address+length wipe would clear memory the caller did not pass and miss
    memory it did.  ``ctypes.from_buffer`` already rejects them with
    ``TypeError``; raising ``SecureMemoryError`` here makes the refusal this
    module's own documented failure type instead of an escaping one.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If ``data`` is not a mutable buffer.
        SecureMemoryError: Raised in three distinct fail-closed cases (the
            native ``ama_secure_memzero`` and the libc ``explicit_bzero`` /
            ``memset_s`` back-ends never raise once they are entered).

            **Case 1 — no native backend, no opt-in.** If the active
            backend is the Python fallback AND none of
            ``AMA_ALLOW_PYTHON_MEMZERO=1`` / ``AMA_SPHINX_BUILD=1`` /
            ``SPHINX_BUILD=1`` is set, the module refuses to wipe at all.
            Falling back silently to a best-effort Python loop in
            production would defeat the security contract. Build the
            native C library
            (``cmake -B build -DAMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=ON && cmake --build build``)
            or set the opt-in env var for development / docs builds.

            **Case 2 — opt-in fallback with residual non-zero byte.** If
            the Python fallback path *is* in use (via opt-in) and the
            post-wipe verification observes a residual non-zero byte
            (optimizer elision, concurrent write, or mis-compiled
            ``memset_explicit``), the function raises. This is a
            deliberate hard failure — a silently incomplete wipe would
            leave secret material in memory.

            **Case 3 — a non-contiguous memoryview.**  A strided or
            multi-dimensional view's bytes are not the ``nbytes`` bytes
            at its address, so an address+length wipe would clear memory
            the caller did not pass and miss memory it did.  Refused
            rather than mis-wiped, and refused uniformly: the native
            back-ends' ``ctypes.from_buffer`` already rejected such a
            view with ``TypeError`` while the Python fallback wiped it
            correctly, so the behaviour used to depend on which back-end
            was selected.  Pass a contiguous view (``bytearray(data)``).

    **Propagation from cleanup contexts.**  ``SecureBuffer.__exit__`` and
    ``secure_buffer()``'s ``finally`` clause both call ``secure_memzero``
    on the way out, so a ``SecureMemoryError`` raised here can propagate
    through a ``with`` statement's exit path.  That is intentional — a
    failed wipe is a security-critical signal that *must not* be
    silenced.  Callers that need to suppress it (e.g. because they are
    already handling an in-flight exception) should catch
    ``SecureMemoryError`` explicitly at the boundary they control.

    Example:
        >>> secret = bytearray(b"sensitive")
        >>> secure_memzero(secret)
        >>> assert all(b == 0 for b in secret)

def constant_time_compare(a: bytes, b: bytes) -> bool:
    """
    Compare two byte sequences in constant time.

    Uses ``ama_consttime_memcmp`` from AMA's native C library, and refuses to
    operate without it.

    INVARIANT-7, no cryptographic fallbacks
    ---------------------------------------
    This function used to fall back to a pure-Python XOR accumulator, and both
    the docstring and ``CONSTANT_TIME_VERIFICATION.md`` described that
    accumulator as the constant-time fallback. INVARIANT-7 names exactly that
    substitution as unacceptable — *"a pure-Python fallback for any
    cryptographic primitive or secret-dependent operation"* — and this is a
    secret-dependent operation by INVARIANT-12's own definition, which lists
    "pre-verification MAC/tag comparisons" as secret material. Its callers are
    HMAC tag verification in ``crypto_api.verify_crypto_package`` and the
    pinned-responder-key check in ``secure_channel``.

    The loop was also not constant-time in fact, only in shape. ``ljust``
    allocates, ``zip`` builds tuples, and ``result |= x ^ y`` runs the CPython
    integer path with its small-int cache — none of which retires a fixed
    instruction count. A fallback that is documented as constant-time and is
    not is worse than no fallback, because callers stop asking.

    So the availability axis is enforced the way INVARIANT-7 requires, at call
    time and in the same shape ``pqc_backends`` uses: no native backend, no
    operation. Import still succeeds (this module has no import-time guard and
    is used for non-cryptographic memory hygiene too), which is also what keeps
    the documented ``AMA_SPHINX_BUILD`` docs path working — the refusal is on
    the call, not the import.

    Cost is bounded by the *shorter* operand
    ----------------------------------------
    Lengths are public metadata here and always have been: a MAC tag, a public
    key and a KEM shared secret each have one fixed size that is published in
    the specification, so an observer learns nothing from a comparison whose
    cost depends on them. What matters is that the cost cannot be driven by an
    attacker, and until this release it could be.

    The previous implementation padded *both* operands to
    ``max(len(a), len(b))`` with ``ljust``. Every caller of this function
    compares a locally computed value against one that arrived from outside —
    ``verify_crypto_package`` recomputes a 32-byte HMAC tag and compares it to
    ``package.hmac_tag``, which is whatever the package says it is. A package
    declaring an 8 MiB tag therefore caused 16 MiB of allocation and an 8 MiB
    scan to reject a 32-byte value — measured — before any other check could
    look at it, and nothing bounded the size it could declare. That is memory
    and CPU amplification on unauthenticated input, reachable from the one
    function whose job is to decide whether that input is authentic.

    Now ``min(len(a), len(b))`` bytes are compared in place — no padding, no
    allocation, no copy — and the length difference is OR-ed into the verdict
    rather than short-circuiting the content scan: a mismatched length does not
    skip the comparison, it is folded into its result. Work is bounded by the
    shorter operand, whichever argument that is, so the bound does not depend
    on a call site passing its own value first. The branch-free property with
    respect to *content* is unchanged: the native ``ama_consttime_memcmp``
    accumulates over all n bytes with no early exit.

    Callers that know the expected length up front should still say so, with
    :func:`lengths_match`, so a malformed length is refused explicitly rather
    than folded into a comparison verdict.

    Args:
        a: First byte sequence.  By convention the locally computed value.
        b: Second byte sequence.  By convention the untrusted one.

    Returns:
        True if sequences are equal, False otherwise

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the native constant-time backend is unavailable.

        True

        False
        >>> constant_time_compare(b"secret", b"secret-and-then-some")
        False

    A deliberately ordinary, deliberately *not* constant-time comparison of two
    lengths, published as API so call sites can perform it explicitly instead
    of leaving it implicit inside :func:`constant_time_compare`.

    Why this is safe, stated once so call sites need not restate it: the values
    AMA compares in constant time — HMAC-SHA3-256 tags, Ed25519 / ML-DSA-65
    public keys, ML-KEM shared secrets — each have exactly one length fixed by
    their specification. An observer who learns that a candidate was the wrong
    length learns nothing they did not already know from the algorithm name.
    The secret is the *content*, and that is what
    :func:`constant_time_compare` protects.

    Why it is worth calling anyway:

    * It refuses malformed input at the boundary, where the error can say
      "expected a 32-byte tag, got 9", rather than folding a structural defect
      into a cryptographic verdict that reads as "the tag did not match".
    * It bounds work on untrusted input before any of it is scanned.
    * It documents, at the call site, that the caller thought about which of
      the two properties — length and content — is the secret one.

    Args:
        a: First byte sequence.
        b: Second byte sequence.

    Returns:
        True if the two have the same length.
