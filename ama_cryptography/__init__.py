# Windows DLL search-path registration (Python 3.8+).
#
# On Windows, Python's loader for compiled extensions (`.pyd` files) does
# NOT search the package's own directory for transitive DLL dependencies
# unless that directory has been registered via ``os.add_dll_directory``.
# Our Cython binding extensions (sha3_binding, ed25519_binding, etc.)
# NEEDED-link against ``ama_cryptography.dll`` which the CMake build
# (D-1, 2026-04-27 audit) bundles next to them in this package's
# directory.  Without this registration the loader cannot find that DLL
# and every binding import dies with ``ImportError: DLL load failed``
# (PR #277 Windows ci.yml regression).
#
# `os.add_dll_directory` returns an opaque cookie object whose ``close()``
# method is invoked at GC time, at which point the directory is removed
# from the AddDllDirectory search list (see Python docs for
# ``os.add_dll_directory`` and Win32 ``AddDllDirectory``).  Discarding the
# return value lets the cookie become unreachable as soon as this module's
# top-level frame finishes evaluating, after which a later
# ``import ama_cryptography.sha3_binding`` (etc.) can intermittently die
# with ``ImportError: DLL load failed`` once the GC closes the cookie.
# Copilot review #11/#21 flagged this; we now append the cookie to a
# module-level list (``_AMA_DLL_DIR_COOKIES``) so it lives for the
# interpreter's lifetime — the package directory stays resolvable for as
# long as ``ama_cryptography`` is importable.  Linux and macOS resolve
# transitive deps via DT_RUNPATH=$ORIGIN baked into each binding
# extension, so this branch is a no-op there.
#
# We use a *list* rather than a single name because (a) it's the
# documented Python pattern for retaining N AddDllDirectory cookies
# (see CPython issue #87466 / docs example) and (b) ``.append()`` is a
# read-use that CodeQL's "py/unused-global-variable" query recognises,
# whereas a write-only single name (the previous form) tripped the
# analyser even though the side effect on the Win32 search path is the
# whole point.  Concretely closes CodeQL findings #504/#505/#506 from
# the PR-285 scan without needing any suppression marker.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PRE-IMPORT binding-extension gate.
#
# The POST integrity stage verifies every compiled binding extension against
# the signed artefact — but a binding extension is an ordinary Python
# extension module, so importing it runs its module-init function, and POST
# runs after the imports that pull them in.  That made binding verification
# post-load DETECTION where the native library already had pre-load REFUSAL:
# a tampered ``sha3_binding`` executed and only then moved the module to the
# ERROR state.
#
# This closes that asymmetry for the case that is unambiguous tampering — a
# file the artefact SIGNS whose bytes differ.  It runs here, at the top of
# package initialisation, before any submodule import, so it is ahead of
# every binding import in the tree.  Verified by construction: importing
# ``ama_cryptography.sha3_binding`` directly initialises this package first,
# so there is no import path that reaches a binding without passing through
# here.
#
# The parenthetical here used to read "all are lazy inside functions except
# ``monitoring``'s ``math_engine``".  That is wrong about five of them: the
# ``_probe_cython_*`` helpers in ``pqc_backends`` are function BODIES but are
# CALLED at module scope (``_probe_cython_ed25519``, ``_probe_cython_dilithium``
# and ``_probe_cython_hkdf`` together, then ``_probe_cython_sha3`` and
# ``_probe_cython_hmac``), so ``ed25519_binding``, ``dilithium_binding``,
# ``hkdf_binding``, ``sha3_binding`` and ``hmac_binding`` all execute their
# module-init functions during ``import ama_cryptography`` — the exact event
# this gate exists to precede.  It does precede them, which is why the
# placement is right; the reason given for it was not.  ``math_engine``, via
# ``monitoring``, is the genuinely lazy one.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow.
#
#   * digest MISMATCH -> raise now, before the module-init function runs.
#     Always fatal, on every build, exactly as the POST stage treats it.
#   * inventory drift (listed-but-missing, present-but-uncovered) -> NOT
#     handled here.  It is not tampering, its correct severity depends on
#     whether the build is anchored, and answering that needs the trust
#     anchor from the native library — which means loading it, which is the
#     work this gate exists to run ahead of.  POST still applies the full
#     anchored/developer split afterwards.
#
# Reading ``_integrity_signature`` is safe this early: it is generated source
# containing only literals and imports nothing from this package.  What that
# does NOT establish is its authenticity, and the boundary is worth stating
# exactly, because an earlier revision of this comment overstated it.
#
# This gate compares each binding against a digest THE ARTEFACT SUPPLIES.  So
# it detects any tampering that leaves the artefact intact — the realistic
# case, since a rebuilt or swapped extension does not update a signed file.
# It cannot, by construction, detect an attacker who rewrites the extension
# AND the artefact together: the forged artefact simply lists the forged
# digest and the comparison succeeds.
#
# The earlier comment claimed that case "is caught by the signature check, as
# before".  That holds only while the NATIVE LIBRARY is authentic, because the
# trust anchor the signature is checked against is compiled into that library
# (`ama_integrity_trust_anchor_pubkey_hex`, see `_self_test.
# _load_integrity_trust_anchor`) and the library itself is admitted by a digest
# the same artefact supplies.  An attacker with write access to the installed
# tree who replaces the library, the artefact and the extensions coherently
# therefore validates against their own key at every step.
#
# So the honest statement of this chain, matching SECURITY.md's "Boundary
# (shared with the trust anchor)" and `tools/verify_install_oob.py`'s
# UNANCHORED verdict: in-tree verification establishes INTERNAL CONSISTENCY,
# not authenticity.  Authenticity requires an anchor from OUTSIDE the tree —
# `tools/verify_install_oob.py --expected-pubkey <key held elsewhere>`, or the
# wheel's own Sigstore/PyPI attestation.  What this gate adds over POST is
# real and narrower than "authenticity": it moves the detection of the
# single-file case to BEFORE the extension's module-init function runs, which
# is the only point at which detection still prevents execution.

        This gate used to read ``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE`` directly, and that was
        the last place in the import path where a bare environment variable
        still bought execution.  With the variable present — a Dockerfile
        ``ENV``, a CI environment, a systemd unit; SECURITY.md itself tells
        release deployments to set ``AMA_FIPS_STRICT``, and build images
        routinely carry the pipeline flag beside it — an attacker with write
        access to the installed tree could edit any module imported after
        POST, have ``_verify_signed_integrity`` classify the resulting .py
        digest mismatch as a repairable stale binding
        (``_self_test._parse_signature_fields``), and get the import to
        complete with exit 0 in every process in that environment.  Nothing
        the attacker had to run; the variable was already there.

        Rounds 1 and 2 of this branch moved the native-load and signature
        paths off the variable and onto launch identity
        (``pqc_backends._process_is_the_integrity_signer``).  This site was
        left on the variable, which made the surrounding comment — that no
        environment variable may buy execution — stale prose rather than a
        description of the code.  It is the same test now.

        Secure-execution mode revokes it, at the call site, exactly as it
        does for the native-load escape: a set-uid/set-gid or file-capability
        process runs on behalf of a less-privileged caller, and that caller
        must not be able to steer this decision at all.

        Failing closed on any error is deliberate: an escape hatch that
        cannot prove it is entitled to open is closed.

# PEP 562 makes ``__getattr__`` invisible to anything that does not run the
# module: mypy, IDEs, and static analysers see ``__all__`` promising a name and
# no definition producing it. The consequence is not cosmetic — a name reachable
# only through ``__getattr__`` is typed ``Any``, so every call through it is
# silently unchecked, and "go to definition" lands nowhere. This block was
# previously partial (13 of 31 names), which is the worst of both: the covered
# names type-checked and the rest quietly did not, with nothing marking the
# boundary.
#
# ``tests/test_lazy_exports.py`` holds the three declarations to each other, so
# adding an export to one and forgetting the others fails rather than degrading.
