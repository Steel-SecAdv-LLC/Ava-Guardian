Key interoperability formats — PKCS#8, SPKI, PEM, JWK, COSE_Key.
================================================================

AMA's key handling was in-house only: opaque octet strings with AMA-defined
layouts. That is fine inside AMA and useless everywhere else. This module is
the boundary layer that lets an AMA key leave the library and come back —
into an X.509 certificate request, a TLS stack, a JOSE token, a COSE message,
a WebAuthn credential, or an HSM's PKCS#11 object.

Design commitments
------------------
**Private and public material never share a code path.** ``PublicKey`` and
``PrivateKey`` are separate types with separate encoders and decoders. There
is no ``encode(key)`` that decides which one it got, because the failure mode
of that design — a private key serialised into the slot where a public key was
expected — is unrecoverable and silent. A ``PrivateKey`` will not serialise
through a public encoder; the type system stops it before the bytes exist.

**Parsing is strict.** See ``ama_cryptography._asn1``: DER only (never BER),
minimal lengths and INTEGERs, no trailing data, deterministic CBOR only. A
permissive parser means two byte strings decode to the same key, which is the
same defect class as signature malleability and reachable by anyone who can
hand you a key file.

**Every algorithm is real.** Nothing here is a placeholder. Where a format has
no finished standard for an algorithm, the call raises
``UnsupportedKeyFormatError`` naming the reason rather than inventing an
encoding — see the limitations table below.

Standards followed
------------------
* **SPKI** — RFC 5280 §4.1.2.7 ``SubjectPublicKeyInfo``; RFC 5480 for the EC
  curves; RFC 8410 for Ed25519/X25519.
* **PKCS#8** — RFC 5958 ``OneAsymmetricKey``; RFC 5915 ``ECPrivateKey`` for
  the EC curves; RFC 8410 ``CurvePrivateKey`` for Ed25519/X25519.
* **PEM** — RFC 7468 (strict: 64-character lines, no headers, exact labels).
* **JWK** — RFC 7517/7518, RFC 8037 for OKP, RFC 8812 for secp256k1;
  thumbprints per RFC 7638.
* **COSE_Key** — RFC 9052/9053, RFC 8812 for secp256k1; deterministic CBOR
  per RFC 8949 §4.2.1.

Limitations, stated precisely
-----------------------------
* **ML-DSA and ML-KEM have no JWK or COSE encoding here.** The JOSE and COSE
  registrations for these algorithms were still drafts at the time of writing.
  Emitting a guess would produce keys that interoperate with nothing and that
  a future revision would have to break. ``UnsupportedKeyFormatError`` names
  this explicitly rather than failing obscurely.
* **PKCS#8 encryption (RFC 5958 ``EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo``) is not
  implemented.** Only the unencrypted form is read and written. Use
  ``ama_cryptography.key_management.SecureKeyStorage`` for keys at rest; a
  password-wrapped PKCS#8 needs a KDF-and-cipher policy decision that belongs
  with the storage layer, not the encoding layer.
* **Certificates are out of scope.** This module handles keys, not X.509
  structures that contain them.
* **Attributes in ``OneAsymmetricKey`` are parsed and discarded.** They are
  accepted so that third-party keys carrying them import cleanly, but nothing
  in AMA consumes them and they are not re-emitted.

Post-quantum private keys
-------------------------
All three arms of the RFC 9881 §6 ``CHOICE`` — ``seed``, ``expandedKey`` and
``both`` — are read and written, and all three are real:

* A ``seed`` is expanded through the deterministic keygen entry point, so it
  imports as a working key rather than an opaque blob.
* A seed that arrives is **kept** on the ``PrivateKey`` and re-emitted in the
  form it arrived in. Expansion is one-way (RFC 9881 §8.1), so dropping it
  would irreversibly downgrade a 54-octet key file into a multi-kilobyte one
  (54 for ML-DSA, 86 for ML-KEM, whose seed is ``d || z``; 34 is the bare
  ``[0] IMPLICIT`` seed TLV, not a key file, and is what this said before).
* A ``both`` key is checked: the seed must expand to the supplied
  ``expandedKey`` or the key is rejected as malformed (RFC 9881 §8.2).
* An ``expandedKey``-only key is checked too, which is the part implementations
  usually skip. ML-DSA's ``rho``, ``s1`` and ``s2`` determine ``t0`` and the
  public key and therefore ``tr``; ML-KEM's ``dk`` embeds ``ek`` and
  ``H(ek)``. Both are recomputed and required to agree. RFC 9881 §8.2 and
  draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates §C.4.1 ship the negative vectors, and
  they are in the test suite.

    "Current context" is the calling thread, and within an asyncio program the

    sees the value the environment set at import, so this is still the shape a
    single-threaded program experiences as "the process-wide default", without
    one thread being able to disable a security check for another.

    **The default is enabled, and that is the right setting for almost every
    caller.** This exists because the checks are not free and the import path is
    reachable by whoever supplies a key file:

    * An ``expandedKey``-only ML-DSA key is checked by re-expanding the matrix
      ``A`` and recomputing ``t0``, the public key and ``tr`` — a full key
      generation's worth of work.
    * An ``expandedKey``-only ML-KEM key is checked by recomputing ``H(ek)``
      *and* running an encapsulate/decapsulate round trip.
    * A ``both``-arm key is checked by expanding its seed and comparing.

    Measured costs are in ``docs/KEY_FORMATS.md``; ``benchmarks/keyformat_import.py``
    is what produces them. Roughly, importing an ML-DSA-87 ``expandedKey`` key
    costs about the same as generating one, which is three orders of magnitude
    more than parsing the DER around it. Anywhere key import is attacker-reachable
    and unauthenticated — a public endpoint that accepts uploaded keys, say — that
    ratio is a denial-of-service lever, and rate-limiting the endpoint is usually
    the better answer than disabling the check. Turning it off is for the case
    where the same keys are re-imported constantly from a store that already
    validated them.

    What stays true with the checks off:

    * Every structural check still runs — DER strictness, the ``CHOICE`` arm,
      lengths, the algorithm OID. This flag governs *cryptographic* consistency
      only.
    * ML-KEM still recovers its encapsulation key, because FIPS 203 §7.1 embeds
      ``ek`` verbatim in ``dk``; extracting it is a slice. If the file *also*
      carries a public key, the two are still required to be equal — that
      comparison is free.
    * A ``seed``-arm key is still expanded, because that is how the key is
      decoded at all, not a check.

    What is given up:

    * ML-DSA no longer derives a public key at import, so
      :attr:`PrivateKey.public_key` is ``None`` and :meth:`PrivateKey.public`
      runs the full check on first use instead. The cost moves; it does not
      vanish.
    * The RFC 9881 §8.2 / draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates §C.4.1 negative
      vectors are no longer rejected at import. RFC 9881 §8.2 says an
      inconsistent key MUST be rejected as malformed, so a deployment that
      disables this is making a conformance decision, not a tuning one. For
      ML-KEM in particular the failure is *silent*: implicit rejection is
      designed not to raise, so a mutated ``dk_PKE`` simply derives a shared
      secret the sender never had.

    A private key cannot be passed to a public-key serialiser, because the
    silent failure that design permits — secret material written into a slot
    the caller intends to publish — has no recovery.

    ``key`` is the seed for Ed25519/X25519 (32 octets, the RFC 8410 form), the

    key for ML-KEM/ML-DSA. ``public_key`` is optional on construction and is
    derived when a format requires it.

    ``seed`` carries the ML-DSA ``xi`` (32 octets) or the ML-KEM ``d || z``
    (64 octets) when one is known, and is ``None`` for every other algorithm.
    It is kept because expansion is one-way: RFC 9881 §8.1 is explicit that
    "once a full key is expanded from seed and the seed discarded, the seed
    cannot be recreated, even if the full expanded private key is available".
    Dropping it on import would silently downgrade a 54-octet seed-form key
    file — 86 for ML-KEM — into a multi-kilobyte expanded one on the next

    so a key that arrives with a seed keeps it, and re-encodes in the form it

    conformant peer rejects, so encapsulating to it yields a shared secret
    nobody else derives, and ML-KEM's implicit rejection guarantees nothing
    raises. Import is where it is visible.

    ML-DSA has no counterpart: FIPS 204's ``pkDecode`` puts no range constraint
    on ``t1`` (the 10-bit packing is onto), so every byte string of the right
    length names a public key. Checking the length is the whole type check, and
    it has already happened by the time this is called.
