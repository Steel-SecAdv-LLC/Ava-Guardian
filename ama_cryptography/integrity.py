Module integrity digest management CLI.

Use ``python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --verify`` to verify integrity,
``python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --show`` to show the current digest,
and ``python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --update`` only from the build
pipeline to refresh the digest.

The --update subcommand is build-pipeline-only.  It regenerates the
integrity digest and (when invoked with ``--sign``) the signed
``_integrity_signature.py`` artefact.  Users running ``--update``
post-install would silently bypass the FIPS 140-3 §4.9.1 tamper-
detection contract: any local edit would be re-blessed by the user's
own machine and the next import would pass verification.

To prevent that, ``--update`` is gated behind the environment variable
``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1``.  The wheel build (setup.py post-build hook /
CMake post-install step) sets the variable before invoking this CLI;
no other invocation should.  Users who actually want to live-modify
source after install must rebuild the wheel — that's the supported
flow for source modifications to a FIPS-validated module.

The signing pipeline lives in ``ama_cryptography._build_sign`` and is
invoked as ``--update --sign``; it uses the in-tree ``ama_ed25519_*``
C kernels via ctypes (INVARIANT-1: no PyCA dependency).
