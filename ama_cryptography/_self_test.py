FIPS 140-3 Power-On Self-Tests (POST) and Module Integrity Verification
=======================================================================

Implements FIPS 140-3 Section 4.9 requirements:
- Known Answer Tests (KAT) for all approved algorithms
- Module integrity verification via SHA3-256 digest
- Pairwise consistency tests for key generation
- Continuous RNG health test

Self-tests run at module import time. On ANY failure the module
enters an ERROR state and all cryptographic operations are refused.

    existed the only way to ask was to re-derive it from the tri-state tuples

    reported a partially-tested module as verified.

    Keys:

        ``anchored``         — True when the verified signature was made under
                               the compiled trust anchor (a release build),
                               False for a per-build/developer signature or the

                               check completed.  The distinction that
                               ``fully_verified`` alone cannot express.
        ``strict_mode``      — whether ``AMA_FIPS_STRICT`` was in force.
        ``tests_run`` / ``tests_passed`` / ``tests_skipped`` — counts of the POST

                               coverage fraction: the POST KAT set is a subset of
                               the approved primitives the module exposes, so a

                               so the log line names what was not covered.

                               since POST short-circuits on the first failure.

#:
#: This exists because ``verify_module_integrity()`` returns a single boolean
#: for two materially different outcomes, and the weaker one was silently
#: promoted to the stronger everywhere downstream — ``module_attestation()``

#: build signed with a per-build ephemeral key BOTH report ``"signed"`` and
#: ``fully_verified: True``.  The one distinction that separates a release
#: artefact from a developer one — anchored vs unanchored — lived solely in the
#: prose of the detail string ("trusted build pubkey" vs "build-time pubkey")
#: and never left the verifier, so a programmatic consumer (a deployment health
#: check, a release gate — see H3, where an unanchored release could be cut)
#: could not read it.  This records it: ``True`` when the signing key matched the

#: Why the last integrity check FAILED, in the one distinction the import-time
#: repair escape in ``__init__`` is allowed to act on.
#:
#: ``"stale-binding"`` — the artefact itself is sound, but a local build output
#: it binds no longer matches: a ``.py`` file or POST KAT vector changed, the
#: native library was rebuilt, or a binding extension was rebuilt.  This is the
#: state a re-signing run exists to clear, and it is what
#: ``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`` may import through so the in-package repair tooling
#: can run.
#:
#: ``"tampering"`` — the artefact is *wrong*, not stale: the Ed25519 signature
#: did not verify, the trust anchor did not match, the fields are malformed or
#: missing, or an anchored build could not verify at all.  Re-signing would
#: launder these, so they hard-fail on every path, including inside a build
#: container that carries ``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`` for its whole lifetime.

#: The distinction is carried by this flag rather than by matching the detail
#: string, for the same reason ``_verify_signed_integrity``'s tri-state is: a
#: security decision that is a function of prose silently changes meaning when
#: the prose is reworded.
#:
#: What this flag deliberately does NOT claim to separate is a rebuilt binary
#: from a tampered one — identical local bytes changing under an intact
#: signature is the same observation either way.  That ambiguity is inherent
#: and pre-existing (``native_backend_refused_on_digest()`` already accepts it
#: for the shared object); it is bounded by the module staying in the ERROR

       construction self-referential and unverifiable).
    2. Every file under ``_post_kats/`` — the Known Answer vectors the
       self-tests check against.  Covering these closes a gap: without it, an
       attacker could swap a KAT vector for one a broken implementation happens
       to pass and defeat the self-test without touching a ``.py`` file, on a
       build whose ``.py`` digest and signature still verified.  Files are
       ordered by name so the build-time signer and this runtime verifier agree
       regardless of the absolute package path.

    Mirrored byte-for-byte in ``_build_sign._compute_package_digest``; pinned
    equal by ``tests/test_native_integrity.py``.

    FRAMING, and why it is not cosmetic.  Until 5.0.0 each entry contributed
    ``name || content`` with no length prefix and no delimiter, and consecutive
    entries were simply concatenated.  A hash of a concatenation commits to the
    concatenation, not to the (filename -> content) MAPPING, so two different
    package trees can produce one digest — and this digest is exactly what the
    Ed25519 artefact signs.  Demonstrated against the shipped signer::

        A/  a.py = b"X"          b.py = b"Y"
        B/  a.py = b"Xb.pyY"     (b.py absent)

        digest(A) == digest(B) == 98aaca986290313a24078bb7c79f8ee8...

    One signature covered both trees.  ``_serialize_binding_digests`` in this
    same module already got this right, and its premise is worth stating rather
    than quoting past: "the NUL terminator makes the (name, digest) framing
    unambiguous ... so no concatenation of entries collides with any other map"
    holds *because* a NUL cannot occur inside a filename and each digest is a
    fixed 32 bytes, so the boundaries are recoverable.  The same sentence about
    a length-free encoding whose fields could contain the delimiter would be
    false.  Meanwhile the ``b"_post_kats/"`` section marker here was itself an
    unframed literal a crafted filename could reproduce.

    Every field is now length-prefixed and every section tagged, and the whole
    is prefixed with a format version, so the encoding is injective: distinct
    (name, content) sequences map to distinct byte strings by construction.
    The version prefix is also the domain separation for the change — a digest
    computed the old way can never equal one computed the new way, so no
    pre-5.0.0 signature verifies against a tree hashed this way.

# honoured whenever it is "up to date": for the default timestamp-based cache
# that means its stored (mtime, size) match the source file, and an attacker
# with write access to the package tree sets exactly those.  So the gap is
# real: leave every ``.py`` pristine (the signature still verifies) and drop a
# ``.pyc`` whose bytecode differs, and the poisoned bytecode runs while the
# source digest and its signature both check out.
#
# This stage closes it by making on-disk bytecode SUBORDINATE to the signed
# source: for every loaded package module it recompiles the (already
# integrity-verified) ``.py`` and refuses any cached ``.pyc`` whose bytecode is
# not a faithful compile of it.  Bytecode is compared structurally — the actual

# objects — rather than by marshalled bytes, so a legitimate ``.pyc`` built at a

    Mirrors CPython's ``_bootstrap_external`` validation (PEP 552).  ``header``
    is the 12 bytes following the magic number: a 4-byte little-endian flags
    field, then either the source mtime and size (timestamp caches) or an
    8-byte source hash (hash-based caches).

    A cache the interpreter would reject is not what executes, so the caller
    treats it exactly like a wrong-magic cache: nothing to bind.  Anything this
    function cannot resolve — an unreadable source, an unknown flag bit — is
    reported as live, so an odd cache is judged rather than waved through.

    THE INTERPRETER'S OWN SETTING IS PART OF THE RULE.  CPython's
    ``SourceLoader.get_code`` validates a hash-based cache only when
    ``_imp.check_hash_based_pycs != "never" and (check_source or
    _imp.check_hash_based_pycs == "always")``.  Reading the flag bits alone
    models that condition wrongly in both directions, and both are reachable:

    * under ``--check-hash-based-pycs never`` the interpreter loads a
      check-source cache WITHOUT validating its hash, so a cache whose hash
      does not match its source executes — while a bit-only reading of the
      header calls it not-live and the ``execution-integrity`` stage records

    """Load the cached bytecode the running interpreter would use for ``src_path``.

    Returns ``(status, code, error)``:

    * ``("verified", code, None)`` — a ``.pyc`` for THIS interpreter version
      exists and its code object was read;
    * ``("skipped", None, None)`` — nothing on disk to bind: no cache written
      (the source is compiled directly, so what runs is already the signed
      source), a cache built by another interpreter version the running one
      will not load, or a cache whose validation header the running interpreter
      would reject (it recompiles from source instead);
    * ``("verified", None, error)`` — a cache exists but could not be read as a
      code object; that is a fault, not a pass.

    The header is *validated*, not skipped, because "what executes" is the
    whole question this stage asks.  PEP 552 gives a ``.pyc`` two validation
    modes, and the running interpreter refuses a cache that fails either one,
    recompiling from the source the integrity stage has already verified:

    * timestamp caches (flag bit 0 clear) carry the source mtime and size, and
      are rejected when either disagrees with the source on disk;
    * hash-based caches carry a source hash, and whether the interpreter checks
      it depends on ``_imp.check_hash_based_pycs`` as well as on the
      ``check_source`` flag (bit 1) — see :func:`_cache_header_is_live`, which
      is where that decision is made.

    An earlier version of this list said the interpreter "only checks it when
    the ``check_source`` flag is set", which is the flag-bits-only model, and
    it is wrong in both directions: under ``--check-hash-based-pycs never`` a
    check-source cache is loaded WITHOUT validation, and under ``always`` an
    unchecked cache IS validated.  Both are reproduced in
    :func:`_cache_header_is_live`'s docstring.  The rule lives there; this
    docstring defers to it rather than restating a second, contradicting
    version of it.

    Judging a cache the interpreter would reject produced a false ``poisoned or
    stale .pyc`` verdict for the most ordinary state there is: edit a lazily
    imported module, re-sign, and the next import failed POST on bytecode that
    never ran.  That failure is not in ``__init__``'s repairable set, so
    ``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`` did not clear it and the error's own remediation
    hint could not either — the tree stayed unimportable until ``__pycache__``
    was removed by hand.  Under ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`` (common in CI)
    eagerly imported modules hit it too, since no import rewrites the cache.

                              policy: an anchored build refuses to continue, an
                              unanchored source checkout falls through to the
                              digest-only path.

    That third case is the one this function used to get wrong.  A missing
    native library was reported as ``(False, "native Ed25519 not built —
    cannot verify signature")`` and became ``FIPS 140-3 POST FAILURE`` — a
    tampering verdict, phrased as a build defect, for a library that was
    usually built perfectly well and merely sitting somewhere the loader had
    not been told to look.  Operators chasing that message went looking for a
    broken C build that did not exist.  A verifier that cannot run has not
    detected anything; it has failed to look.

    The signature artefact is generated at wheel build time by
    ``ama_cryptography._build_sign`` using the in-tree
    ``ama_ed25519_sign`` C kernel (INVARIANT-1 — no PyCA dependency)
    with an ephemeral, per-build private key.  Only the public key
    and signature ship with the wheel; the private key is discarded
    immediately after signing.  At runtime we recompute the digest
    and call ``ama_ed25519_verify`` with the embedded pubkey.

    Failure modes:
      - signature module missing      → caller falls back to digest-only
      - digest mismatch vs embedded   → tampered .py files between build and now
      - signature verify returns False → tampered signature module (the
        embedded fields were edited post-build to match a tampered .py
        digest), or the native verify call itself reports a bad sig

    * ``note`` is the human-readable suffix appended to the integrity detail.
    * ``native_ok`` is True only when the loaded object's digest matched the

    The three non-matching outcomes are deliberately distinct: an
    AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH override is the operator's own substitution (proceed,
    unverified); an unreadable object fails closed on an anchored build but only
    warns on a developer one; a digest mismatch is tampering and always fails.

    The digest compared is the one recorded by the PRE-LOAD verification ONLY
    when the loader actually mapped the descriptor it hashed —
    ``preload_digest_is_of_mapped_bytes``, which ``_try_load_library`` sets on
    its ``/proc/self/fd`` branch and nowhere else.  There, no post-load file
    swap can make this stage describe different bytes than the ones executing.

    Everywhere else — Windows' ``CDLL(path, winmode=0)``, and the plain
    ``CDLL(path)`` fallback used on macOS and on any Linux without procfs — the
    loader performs a SECOND, independent path resolution, so the recorded
    digest need not describe the mapped bytes and this stage re-reads the path
    instead.  That re-read is the whole reason ``_try_load_library``'s
    docstring can accept the hash-then-load window on those platforms: a file
    swapped between the hash and the ``dlopen`` fails here.  Preferring the
    recorded digest unconditionally removed that, and reported "native library
    verified" for bytes nothing had verified.

    Re-reading the path is also the fallback for loads that skipped pre-load
    hashing (an override, or a missing artefact).  A match is reported as
    verified even under an override: bytes identical to the signed bytes are
    the signed library, wherever the operator loaded it from.

    This was a keygen/sign/verify roundtrip, which is a pairwise consistency
    test rather than a Known Answer Test, and it had a specific blind spot: a
    verifier that returns True unconditionally passes a roundtrip.  So does one
    whose scalar arithmetic is wrong in a way that sign and verify share.  And
    because the module-integrity check is itself an ``ama_ed25519_verify``
    call, an always-accept verifier would have carried both this stage and the
    signature check that is supposed to detect tampered sources.

    Three checks now, in the order that localises a fault:

    1. **Known answer** — RFC 8032 §7.1 TEST 1 fixes the seed, so the derived
       public key and the signature over the known message have exactly one
       correct value.  A roundtrip cannot catch an implementation that is
       self-consistent and wrong; this can.
    2. **Negative** — a corrupted signature must be REJECTED.  This is what
       catches the always-accept verifier.
    3. **Pairwise consistency** — a freshly generated key still round-trips,
       which is the FIPS 140-3 §4.9.2 requirement for a keygen path.

    """Compute the platform-aware minimum absolute mean-time delta floor.

    The POST timing oracle needs an absolute-effect-size floor to reject
    measurement-noise false positives from a high-|t| paired test.  The
    correct floor is a function of the host's actual ``perf_counter_ns``
    resolution — there is no value that is simultaneously safe on every
    OS/runner combination if you hardcode a constant:

    * Linux / macOS:  resolution is typically 1 ns (CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW).
      Bias from runner jitter has been observed at delta=25 ns / |t|=8.34
      on shared Ubuntu 3.11 GitHub-hosted runners, and a 50 ns floor was
      then falsified in the field: delta=51 ns / |t|=11.48 of pure jitter
      on a shared ubuntu-latest runner (job 97259726191, Python 3.13,
      2026-08-23) failed a binary whose memcmp the deterministic callgrind
      `consttime` target measures at zero cross-class instructions and
      whose POST passed on every sibling lane at the same commit.  The
      100 ns absolute floor is ~2x the worst observed artefact, the same
      calibration rule the dudect floor uses.
    * Windows:  ``QueryPerformanceCounter`` reports a 100 ns resolution
      via ``time.get_clock_info('perf_counter').resolution`` even on
      modern hardware; quantization noise alone can produce mean deltas
      that round up to 100-200 ns under coverage-instrumented Python
      3.11.  A 50 ns floor is *below* the platform's native granularity
      there — every paired-difference observation snaps to a multiple
      of 100 ns, so the smallest non-zero delta the oracle can ever see
      is 100 ns, and a constant 50 ns floor cannot filter it.

    Fix: scale the floor to ``max(absolute_floor, K * resolution_ns)``
    where ``K=4`` is a conservative safety multiplier over the per-sample
    quantization step.  With 10 000 paired samples the standard error
    of the mean is roughly ``resolution_ns / sqrt(n) ≈ resolution_ns/100``;
    K=4 puts the floor at ~400× SEM on a coarse-clock host, well above
    where pure quantization noise can drive the mean delta, while
    remaining well below the >>500 ns signal a real early-exit memcmp
    leak over 256 bytes produces (the byte loop alone is ~256 ns even
    at 1 ns/byte memory throughput).

    Linux/macOS:  ``max(100, 4*1) = 100 ns`` (absolute floor dominates)
    Windows:      ``max(100, 4*100) = 400 ns`` (resolution floor dominates)

    The floor is computed once at module import.  Operators who need a
    different floor for a specific deployment can override via
    ``AMA_POST_TIMING_MIN_EFFECT_NS`` — explicitly opt-in and logged so
    the deviation appears in audit logs.

    Single deterministic pass with high statistical power (no retry).

    Runs interleaved comparisons with a first-byte mismatch and a last-byte
    mismatch, measures execution time for each, then computes Welch's
    t-statistic.  If |t| > ``_DUDECT_THRESHOLD`` (4.5), the comparison
    function may leak timing information through data-dependent early exit.
    POST also requires a small absolute effect-size floor before failing:
    GitHub-hosted runners have produced |t| > 4.5 (with deltas observed up to
    51 ns on Linux — job 97259726191 — and 100-200 ns on Windows where
    ``QueryPerformanceCounter`` has 100 ns granularity) from host jitter
    alone, while a real early-exit
    memcmp over 256 bytes is orders of magnitude larger (>>500 ns).
    ``_TIMING_MIN_EFFECT_NS`` is computed at module import as
    ``max(100, 4 × perf_counter_resolution_ns)`` so the floor scales with
    the host clock — 100 ns on Linux/macOS (1 ns resolution), 400 ns on
    Windows (100 ns resolution).  Both values stay well below any real-leak
    signal while keeping POST fail-closed for genuine leaks.  The
    deterministic single-pass design means the ``False`` outcome is
    reproducible on the *same* host: a one-off CI re-run does not
    "re-roll" the result.

    The previous implementation retried up to three times with growing
    sample sizes and accepted ANY pass.  That pattern is a timing-leak
    *amplifier*: a real leak that happens to fall just under the
    threshold on a high-noise retry would be reported as a pass.  By
    running a single 10 000-iteration pass — equivalent in power to
    one of the previous retry attempts — POST gives the same answer
    every time for a given binary and host, with no opportunity to
    re-roll a borderline result into a green light.  Real timing
    leaks (|t| >> 4.5) reproduce; scheduler noise is averaged out by
    the warmup phase + interleaved measurement design.  The two
    classes are intentionally both mismatches (first byte versus last
    byte) so POST tests for data-dependent early exit without
    conflating equal-result fast paths with leak evidence on noisy CI
    hosts.

    Returns:
        * ``(True, detail)``  — implementation is consistent with
          constant-time on this host.
        * ``(False, detail)`` — measured |t| exceeds the threshold;
          treat as a real leak and refuse to enter OPERATIONAL.
        * ``(None, detail)``  — native consttime backend not loaded;
          the test cannot run.  Honoured by the POST runner as a
          skip (NOT as a pass), and escalated to ERROR under

    """Fail POST when the native cryptographic backend did not load at all.

    INVARIANT-7 ("No Cryptographic Fallbacks, Ever") is unambiguous: when the
    native constant-time C backend is unavailable the library must refuse to
    operate and must raise at import, load or initialisation time, and "a
    warning without a hard stop" is explicitly named as an unacceptable
    substitute.

    That enforcement was documented as living in the module-level guards of
    ``crypto_api``, ``key_management`` and ``legacy_compat`` — all three of
    which this package imports **lazily**.  ``crypto_api`` sits behind
    ``__init__.__getattr__``, so ``import ama_cryptography`` never executed any
    of them.  A checkout with no discoverable ``libama_cryptography`` therefore
    imported cleanly, emitted a UserWarning, skipped eight of eleven
    self-tests, and reached OPERATIONAL: a warning without a hard stop,
    precisely the shape INVARIANT-7 rules out.  POST is the one thing that
    always runs on import, so POST is where the invariant has to be enforced.

    A *partly* populated backend is not this stage's concern — a build that
    omits, say, SPHINCS+ still leaves the per-algorithm KAT to skip and warn
    (or to fail under ``AMA_FIPS_STRICT``).  This stage answers only the
    all-or-nothing question: is there a native backend at all?

    The documented docs-build override (``AMA_SPHINX_BUILD=1`` /
    ``SPHINX_BUILD=1``) is honoured, matching the sole exception INVARIANT-7
    carves out so Sphinx autodoc can introspect signatures.  It permits the
    import, not any cryptographic operation: every native wrapper still
    raises, and ``module_attestation()["fully_verified"]`` stays False.
