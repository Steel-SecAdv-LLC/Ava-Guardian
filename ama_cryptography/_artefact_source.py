"""Read the signed integrity artefact from its SOURCE TEXT, never through import.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
======================

``_integrity_signature.py`` is generated data: a handful of module-level
literals (digests, an Ed25519 public key, a signature) that every integrity
control in this package consumes.  Three of those controls read it *before* the
package's bytecode has been validated:

* ``ama_cryptography.__init__._refuse_tampered_bindings_before_import()`` — the
  pre-import binding-extension gate, whose whole purpose is to refuse a tampered
  ``.so`` BEFORE its module-init function runs;
* ``ama_cryptography.pqc_backends._expected_native_digest()`` — the pre-load
  check on ``libama_cryptography`` itself, for the same reason (a shared object
  runs its constructors the moment it is mapped);
* the POST ``integrity`` stage, which runs before the ``execution-integrity``
  stage that binds cached bytecode to signed source.

All three obtained the literals with ``from ama_cryptography import
_integrity_signature``.  An ordinary import does not read the ``.py`` — it reads
``__pycache__/_integrity_signature.cpython-3XX.pyc`` whenever a cache exists
whose PEP 552 header matches the source's ``(mtime, size)``.  Nothing had
validated that cache at any of those three points.

THE ATTACK THIS CLOSES, AS MEASURED
-----------------------------------

Against a signed tree with the extensions bound, in a scratch copy:

1. flip one byte of a signed ``hkdf_binding*.so``.  With no bytecode cache
   (``python -B``) the pre-import gate refuses, as designed::

       hkdf_binding…so: digest MISMATCH — bytes differ from the signed build
       Refused BEFORE any binding was imported.

2. write ``__pycache__/_integrity_signature.cpython-311.pyc`` compiled from the
   artefact source with ONE entry of ``INTEGRITY_BINDING_DIGESTS_HEX`` replaced
   by the tampered object's real digest, carrying the untouched source's
   ``(mtime, size)`` in the header so CPython accepts it.  Leave
   ``_integrity_signature.py`` byte-identical — its Ed25519 signature still
   verifies.

3. import the package::

       IMPORT SUCCEEDED — binding modules executed: [… 'ama_cryptography.hkdf_binding' …]

The gate compared the tampered object against the tampered object's own digest.
Writing one file in ``__pycache__/`` — no code poisoning, no re-signing —
converted a pre-execution refusal back into nothing at all.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH
-------------------------------------

Reading the source text removes the artefact-as-DATA poisoning: the literals now
come from bytes the signature covers, so changing them means changing a signed
file, which is exactly the attacker the pre-load checks are documented to stop.

It does not, and cannot, defend against poisoning the CHECKER's own bytecode — a
``__init__.pyc`` or ``pqc_backends.pyc`` written by the same attacker runs
whatever they like.  That is the boundary ``SECURITY.md`` already states ("a
self-check written in Python cannot vouch for the bytecode of its OWN module"),
it is detected after the fact by the POST ``execution-integrity`` stage, and it
requires substituting code rather than data.  The distinction is the point: the
artefact is data this code consumes, not the code itself, and it had no business
being reachable through the import system.

``_build_sign._write_signature_module`` already unlinks this cache after
writing, which kept the honest case working and left the adversarial one open.

    Returns ``None`` when the file is absent — an unsigned tree, where there is
    nothing to check against and every caller already has a documented
    behaviour for that state.

    Raises :class:`ArtefactSourceError` when the file is present but does not
    parse, when a top-level assignment is not a literal, or when it parses to
    NO literal assignments at all.  A generated file of constants that has
    stopped being a generated file of constants is tampering, and refusing is
    the same fail-closed rule the callers apply to a digest that does not
    match.

    That last case is the one that was silent.  An empty (or literal-free)
    artefact parses cleanly to zero values, and the ``ArtefactFields`` it used
    to produce answered ``None`` to every ``getattr`` a caller makes — so
    ``__init__._refuse_tampered_bindings_before_import`` took its
    ``not signed -> return`` branch and ``pqc_backends._expected_native_digest``
    returned ``None``, and BOTH pre-load gates passed without comparing
    anything.  A signed tree whose artefact has been truncated is not an
    unsigned tree; it is a signed tree with the signatures removed, and the
    difference is exactly the one these gates exist to notice before a shared
    object is mapped.  ``Path.write_text`` truncates in place, so the state was
    reachable without an attacker at all — see ``_build_sign``, where the write
    is now atomic.

    Only module-level ``NAME = <literal>`` and ``NAME: ann = <literal>`` forms
    are collected.  Anything else in the file — imports, functions, conditionals
    — is a shape the generator never emits, and is rejected rather than skipped:
    silently ignoring it would let an attacker hide the real assignment behind a
    construct this reader does not model.
