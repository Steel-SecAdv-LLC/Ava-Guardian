Ascon lightweight cryptography (NIST SP 800-232)
================================================

Thin Python surface over the native implementation in ``src/c/ama_ascon.c``.
Every byte of output is produced in C; this module marshals arguments and
refuses malformed input before it reaches the boundary (INVARIANT-5).

Two functions from SP 800-232 (final, 2025-08-13) are exposed:

* :func:`aead128_encrypt` / :func:`aead128_decrypt` — **Ascon-AEAD128**,
  a 128-bit-key, 128-bit-nonce, 128-bit-tag AEAD.
* :func:`hash256` — **Ascon-Hash256**, a 256-bit hash.

Why this is here alongside AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305
------------------------------------------------------------
It is not a replacement for either, and it is not faster than either on a
machine with AES-NI or ARMv8 crypto extensions. Ascon is the *constrained
device* member of this library's algorithm set: a 320-bit state, no lookup
tables of any kind, and a code footprint small enough for targets that cannot
host the other two well. It is also the only lightweight AEAD NIST has
standardized. See ``docs/decisions/0001-adopt-ascon.md`` for the full
rationale, including the measured cost on 64-bit hosts.

Interoperability warning
------------------------
SP 800-232 is **not** byte-compatible with the earlier Ascon v1.2 / CAESAR
submission — different rate, different IV, and a different bit-ordering
convention for the domain-separation constant. A peer running a v1.2-era
Ascon library will not interoperate with this one, and the failure presents as
a tag mismatch rather than as a version error. Confirm which specification a
counterparty implements before deploying.

Nonce discipline
----------------
Ascon-AEAD128 is a nonce-based AEAD with **no** nonce-misuse resistance.
Repeating a ``(key, nonce)`` pair reveals the XOR of the two plaintexts'
**first 16-byte block** — and, with enough reused-nonce pairs, gives an
attacker leverage on the internal state. It is not a total keystream reuse:
because the sponge absorbs plaintext into the rate before permuting, the two
states diverge after the first block, so later blocks do not XOR to the
plaintext XOR the way a stream cipher's would. That is a narrower failure
than ChaCha20-Poly1305 under the same misuse, not a safe one — treat nonce
uniqueness as mandatory either way.

:func:`aead128_encrypt` will not generate a nonce for you silently — pass one
explicitly, or use :func:`generate_nonce`, which draws through the
health-tested CSPRNG (``secure_token_bytes``).
