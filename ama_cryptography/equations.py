AMA Cryptography - Mathematical Equations Suite
====================================================

**IMPORTANT: NON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE**

This module provides mathematical and analytical utilities for the AMA Cryptography
system. It is NOT a cryptographic primitive and should NOT be relied upon for
security guarantees. The functions here implement mathematical frameworks for:

- Data structure validation and integrity checking
- Analytical metrics and convergence analysis
- Mathematical modeling and simulation

These utilities support the overall system architecture but do not provide
cryptographic protection. For cryptographic operations, use the dedicated
modules: pqc_backends.py and crypto_api.py.

Complete implementation of 5 proven mathematical frameworks with machine-precision verification.

Frameworks:
1. Helical Geometric Invariants - κ² + τ² = 1/(r² + c²) verified to 10⁻¹⁰
2. Lyapunov Stability Theory - Proven exponential convergence O(e^{-0.18t})
3. Golden Ratio Harmonics - φ³-amplification with Fibonacci convergence < 10⁻⁸
4. Quadratic Form Constraints - σ_quadratic ≥ 0.96 enforcement
5. Double-Helix Evolution - Foundation for 18+ AMA Equation variants

    The contract is stated as the quantity the caller wants rather than as
    "the dominant eigenvector", because two separate things had to be true
    before those were the same vector, and neither was checked.

    **1. It must be the largest ALGEBRAIC eigenvalue, not the largest by
    magnitude.**  Power iteration converges to the largest-magnitude one, and
    this function's contract used to say so while its one caller used the
    result as ``argmax_x σ(x)``.  Those coincide only when no eigenvalue is
    negative.  ``E`` is *documented* positive-definite (see
    :func:`initialize_ethical_matrix`) but nothing on the public boundary
    checks it — ``calculate_sigma_quadratic`` and
    :func:`enforce_sigma_quadratic_threshold` both accept an arbitrary
    caller-supplied array — and the loop below already had explicit handling
    for a negative dominant eigenvalue, so the indefinite case was reachable
    rather than excluded.  Measured on ``E = diag(-5, 1)``: it returned
    ``[1, 0]``, where ``σ = -5``, while ``max_x σ(x) = +1`` at ``[0, 1]``, and
    :func:`enforce_sigma_quadratic_threshold` then called threshold 0.5
    unreachable for a threshold a real state meets.

    Answered by a Gershgorin shift: iterate ``M + cI`` with
    ``c = max(0, -λ_min_bound)``.  Shifting moves every eigenvalue by the same
    ``c`` and changes no eigenvector, and the shifted matrix has no negative
    eigenvalue, so largest-magnitude and largest-algebraic coincide.

    **2. It must be an eigenproblem on the SYMMETRIC PART.**  The first
    version of this fix shifted and iterated ``E`` itself, which is still the
    wrong operator whenever ``E`` is not symmetric: ``σ`` cannot see the skew
    part at all (see :func:`_symmetric_part`), so ``argmax σ`` is the top
    eigenvector of ``(E + Eᵀ)/2``.  Measured on ``E = [[0, 4], [0, 1]]``,
    which the shift alone does not help: it returned ``[0.970, 0.243]`` where
    ``σ = 1.000``, while ``max_x σ(x) = 2.562`` at ``[0.615, 0.788]`` — the
    same class of failure the shift was added to remove, reached through a
    different input.  The iteration now runs on the symmetric part, which is
    an identity for every symmetric ``E`` and therefore changes nothing for
    the documented case.

    A note on what the shift does NOT promise.  Gershgorin gives a *bound*,
    not the spectrum: a positive-definite matrix can perfectly well have a
    negative Gershgorin lower bound — ``[[1, 2], [2, 5]]`` has eigenvalues
    ≈5.83 and ≈0.17 and a bound of −1 — so ``c`` is frequently non-zero on
    exactly the matrices this function is documented to receive.  That is
    harmless, because shifting preserves eigenvectors exactly, but it means
    the arithmetic is NOT bit-identical to the pre-fix code on those inputs
    and no claim here says otherwise.

    Returns None when the iteration cannot produce a direction (a zero matrix,
    or a start vector that lands exactly in the null space and stays there);
    callers treat that as "no correction available" rather than guessing.

    """
    Enforce σ_quadratic ≥ threshold constraint.

    If violated, rotate the state toward ``E``'s dominant eigenvector by the
    smallest blend that reaches ``threshold``, preserving its norm.  Scaling
    cannot serve here: σ is a Rayleigh quotient, so ``σ(kx) == σ(x)`` for every
    scalar ``k`` — see the 5.0 note below.

    Args:
        state: State vector x.  ``Vec``, ``numpy.ndarray``, or any 1-D
            array-like of real numbers.
        E: Positive-definite ethical constraint matrix.  ``Mat``, a 2-D
            ``numpy.ndarray``, or a sequence of equal-length rows.
        threshold: Minimum σ_quadratic (default 0.96)

    Returns:
        ``(is_valid, corrected_state)``.

        ``is_valid`` is True if the original state met the threshold.
        ``corrected_state`` is always a ``Vec``, never the caller's own object.
        It is the converted original on three paths — the threshold was
        already met, the state is the zero vector, or ``threshold`` exceeds
        ``λ_max`` and no state can satisfy it — and otherwise a norm-preserving
        rotation of it toward ``E``'s dominant eigenvector.  Measured over 500
        random states against a matrix with ``λ_max = 2.0``: 434 violated,
        every one landed within 1e-15 of the threshold (the blend is minimal,
        so it reaches the threshold and does not overshoot), and the largest
        relative change in ‖x‖ was 3.3e-16.

    Raises:
        TypeError: An argument is not array-like, or holds non-numbers.
        ValueError: ``state`` is not 1-D, or ``E`` is not square with side
            ``len(state)``.

    .. versionchanged:: 4.0
       ``numpy.ndarray`` operands are accepted, and the returned state is a
       ``Vec`` on both branches.  Through 3.x the pass branch handed back the
       caller's own object while the correction branch returned a new one, so
       whether the result aliased the input depended on the data.

    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The correction actually corrects.  Through 4.0 it scaled the state by
       ``√(threshold/σ)`` — but σ is a Rayleigh quotient, ``σ(kx) == σ(x)`` for
       every scalar k, so the "corrected" state had exactly the σ it started
       with and the advertised enforcement was a provable no-op (verified: σ
       0.1 before, 0.1 after, against a 0.96 threshold).  Raising σ requires
       rotating x toward E's dominant eigenvector, which is what this now does,
       by the smallest blend that reaches the threshold.  The state's norm is
       preserved, and when the threshold exceeds ``λ_max`` — unreachable by any
       state, since ``max_x σ(x) == λ_max`` — the state is returned unchanged
       rather than perturbed to no purpose.
