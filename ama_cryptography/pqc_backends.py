    ``from_buffer`` so session keys stay in their wipeable bytearray storage
    instead of being materialised as transient heap copies.  Read-only
    memoryviews may not expose a writable buffer for ``from_buffer``;
    converting those to bytes is limited to non-wipeable public inputs and
    never used by SecureSession key storage.

    PERFORMANCE: this is a hand-written context manager, not a
    ``@contextlib.contextmanager`` generator, and it handles all of a call's
    buffers in one enter/exit.  The generator form cost ~1 us per buffer per

    in May 2026 sat ~2.1x above what the wrappers could deliver.  ``bytes``
    inputs — the overwhelmingly common case — take no view at all and are
    passed straight through, exactly as ctypes itself accepts them.

    freshly-built library, `pqc_backends._native_lib` is None, and
    `secure_memory` — which takes its OWN handle at its own import time — has

    applies to every platform whose freshly-built library necessarily differs

    What is tested is `__main__`'s identity AND, for a mixed-mode entry point,
    the mode: the process must BE the signer and be running its writing
    subcommand.  An attacker who can choose which program the victim runs can
    already run anything; an attacker who can only set a variable cannot
    change `__main__` or `sys.orig_argv`.  `AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1` is still
    required alongside it — the signing entry points refuse to act without it
    — so this narrows the old condition rather than replacing it with a
    different one of equal breadth.

    The mode half is not decoration.  Identity alone answered for the whole
    of `ama_cryptography.integrity`, whose `--verify` and `--show` subcommands
    are the documented way to CHECK an installation and write nothing.  In an
    environment that carries the build-pipeline variable — the Dockerfile
    `ENV` / CI / systemd shape named above — running the documented verify
    command therefore mapped a shared object that had just failed its digest
    check, executing its constructors before any verdict was printed.  The
    variable was still a necessary ingredient of a fail-open, which is what
    this check was written to end, so `--update` must now also be present.

    Secure-execution mode revokes it regardless, at the call site, exactly as
    it already did for the environment variable.

    Two windows are recognised, because ``__main__``'s spec is not populated
    for the whole life of a ``python -m`` process:

    1. ``__main__.__spec__.name`` — authoritative once runpy has bound the
       target module into ``__main__``.  This is the check as originally
       built, and it covers every call made while the signer's own code runs
       (``secure_memzero`` during signing, the native-load override, …).
    2. ``sys.orig_argv`` — the interpreter's own record of the command line
       (Python >= 3.10, this package's floor).  runpy imports the *parent
       package* before it rebinds ``__main__``, so during that import —
       where POST runs — the spec is still ``None`` and check 1 cannot
       identify anyone.  The first exercised release dry run failed exactly
       there: ``tools/resign_wheel.py`` launches
       ``python -m ama_cryptography._build_sign`` against an anchored wheel
       tree whose artefact it just deleted, and the anchored missing-artefact
       refusal fired during the parent import with the identity check blind.
       ``sys.orig_argv`` records how the interpreter was started.  Stated
       precisely, because an earlier revision called it "immutable truth":
       it is a plain mutable list, and anything executing in-process can
       rewrite it, exactly as it can rewrite ``__main__.__spec__``.  Neither
       window resists an in-process adversary; both resist one who can only
       set an environment variable, which is the boundary being drawn.  Note
       that PYTHONPATH plus a planted ``sitecustomize.py`` (or a ``.pth``
       file) turns an environment-variable adversary into an in-process one
       — that is a gap in the surrounding design, not something this check
       can close by itself.

    be told apart from one that was never built.  The OSError is still
    swallowed (discovery must keep walking the search path), but it is no
    longer discarded.

    PRE-LOAD VERIFICATION.  A shared object executes its constructors the
    moment it is mapped, before any power-on self-test can examine it — so a
    check that runs only after ``dlopen`` detects tampering but does not
    prevent the tampered code from running.  Every candidate's bytes are
    therefore hashed *first*, and when the integrity artefact carries a
    native digest and ``verify_digest`` is true, a mismatch refuses to map
    the object at all.  On Linux the mapping then goes through
    ``/proc/self/fd`` on the very descriptor that was hashed: a path swap
    between the two steps cannot occur (the descriptor pins the inode), so
    what remains is an in-place overwrite of that inode inside the window —
    an attacker who could do that could have pre-written the file, which the
    hash catches — and platforms without procfs, where hash-then-load's
    window is accepted and the POST stage re-verifies after load as before.
    The recorded ``preload_digest_hex`` is the digest of the mapped bytes ON
    THAT BRANCH ONLY, and ``preload_digest_is_of_mapped_bytes`` records which
    branch was taken.  The POST integrity stage prefers the recorded digest
    when that flag is set and re-reads the path when it is not — which is what
    makes "the POST stage re-verifies after load as before" true on the
    platforms this paragraph accepts the window for.

    One deliberate carve-out.  The ``AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH`` override
    (``verify_digest=False``) is the operator's own substitution: its digest
    is still recorded, but a mismatch is reported by POST as UNVERIFIED
    rather than blocked here.

    ``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`` is NOT a second carve-out, and used to be.  It
    demoted the refusal to a warning and then mapped the object anyway, on the
    reasoning that the tools which refresh a stale artefact after a rebuild
    live inside this package and must be able to import it.  The premise is
    right; the scope was not.  ``os.environ`` is read on EVERY import, so any
    attacker who could set one variable in the victim's process turned this
    pre-execution refusal into a post-hoc report — the definition of a
    fail-open, and it required no code execution to reach.

    The premise is honoured by scope instead of by severity.  The re-signing
    run does need the library mapped (it signs with the in-tree Ed25519 kernel;
    INVARIANT-1 forbids a PyCA dependency), so a mapping has to be possible —
    but only from inside the tool that is deliberately blessing that library,
    never from an ordinary import that merely inherited an environment.

    interpreter is not a capability an environment variable confers; it
    requires already executing code there, at which point this check is moot.

    Such a process is executing on behalf of a less-privileged caller, so
    environment variables that caller controls — ``AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH`` above
    all — must not be allowed to steer code loading. This is the same rule the
    dynamic loader applies to ``LD_PRELOAD``.

    Four signals, consulted in this order, most authoritative first:

    1. ``issetugid(2)`` (:func:`_libc_issetugid`) — the platform's own record,
       on macOS, the BSDs, Solaris and musl.
    2. ``getauxval(AT_SECURE)`` (:func:`_libc_getauxval_at_secure`) — the
       loader's own flag, on glibc >= 2.16 and musl. Survives a masked
       ``/proc``.
    3. ``/proc/self/auxv`` (:func:`_auxv_at_secure`) — the same flag read by
       hand, for libcs predating (2).
    4. ``uid != euid or gid != egid`` — the classic set-uid/set-gid test.

    **The answer is their OR, and that is the whole of the contract.** The
    first signal that says True ends it; a signal that says *False* does not
    end anything, because each covers a case the others cannot see. (1)-(3)
    catch file capabilities — a ``setcap`` binary runs privileged with
    ``uid == euid``, so (4) sees nothing — while (4) keeps working where no
    kernel-side signal is reachable at all.

    **An unavailable signal is not a negative one.** Each of (1)-(3) returns
    ``None`` for "could not tell" — symbol absent, procfs masked, no
    ``AT_SECURE`` entry — and ``None`` neither answers True nor suppresses the
    signals after it. It is not treated as True either: this function does not
    fail closed on ignorance, it moves on to a signal that can answer. Only (4)
    remains after all three, and only when *it* is unavailable too does the
    answer become False by exhaustion.

    Returns:
        True when any signal reports privileged execution. False when every
        signal that could run reported unprivileged, and False on a platform
        where none of them exists (Windows: no ``issetugid``, no auxiliary
        vector, no ``os.getuid``) — there, the concept has no referent, and the

# says nothing about the artefact the loader actually mapped.  Asking the

# into a runtime check against the running object.

    Only if the native library was verified and loaded first — and this is a

    Every one of the five binding extensions carries
    ``DT_NEEDED [libama_cryptography.so.5]`` and
    ``RUNPATH [$ORIGIN:...]`` (verified with ``readelf -dW``).  Importing one
    therefore makes the dynamic loader map ``libama_cryptography.so.5`` out of
    the package directory, and a shared object runs its ELF constructors the
    moment it is mapped.  The loader performs no digest check; it cannot.

    ``_find_native_library`` exists to make sure that never happens to an
    unverified object: it opens the candidate, hashes the bytes, and loads it
    through ``/proc/self/fd/N`` so the bytes mapped are the bytes hashed, and
    on a mismatch it refuses and returns ``None`` **without mapping** — the
    refusal message says exactly that.

    The probes below then ran unconditionally, so on the refusal path the
    package imported ``ed25519_binding`` a few statements later and the loader
    mapped the very object that had just been rejected.  Measured, with one
    byte flipped in the in-package ``libama_cryptography.so.5.0.0`` and the
    other candidates removed: the import raises ``CryptoModuleError`` as it
    should, and ``/proc/self/maps`` nevertheless contains the tampered library,
    whose constructors have run.  An attacker able to replace that file got
    code execution in the victim's process *despite* the integrity check
    correctly detecting the tampering — which is the whole of what the pre-load
    refusal was for.

    So: no verified native library, no binding import.  A binding cannot work
    without the library in any case (it is a DT_NEEDED, not a soft dependency),
    so nothing is lost, and the docs-build override that reaches OPERATIONAL
    with no native library simply runs without the Cython accelerators.

    Whether an ML-KEM encapsulation key passes FIPS 203 §7.2 input validation.

    §7.2 mandates two checks before an encapsulation key may be used: the type

    ``t_hat`` must be below ``q = 3329``, equivalently
    ``ByteEncode_12(ByteDecode_12(ek))`` must reproduce ``ek``.

    The modulus check is the one implementations skip, and skipping it is not
    cosmetic: a conformant peer rejects an out-of-range key, so encapsulating to
    one produces a shared secret nobody else derives — and ML-KEM's implicit
    rejection is designed to fail silently, so nothing raises. 767 of every 4096

# Verification only. LMS is a stateful scheme and RFC 8554 §5.4.1 makes the
# one-time leaf index the whole of its security: a signer that releases a
# signature before durably reserving the index can, after a crash, sign twice
# under one LM-OTS key, and two signatures under one LM-OTS key yield a forged
# third. That guarantee lives in a durable state manager, not in the maths, so
# the signing half is withheld until such a manager exists and has been tested
# against interrupted writes. `lms_signing_available()` answers that question
# directly rather than leaving a caller to discover a missing name.
#
# Verification holds no secret and keeps no state, so it cannot be misused by
# being called twice — and it is the half with the interoperability value:
# HSS/LMS is deployed overwhelmingly as a firmware-update signature, one
# offline signer against a very large verifier population.

    Constant-time verify a pre-shim Argon2id tag.

    Stored hashes derived by those versions sit in a non-spec bit-space and
    will not verify against the post-fix :func:`native_argon2id`.  This
    helper reproduces the legacy derivation and compares against
    ``expected_tag`` with :c:func:`ama_consttime_memcmp` so a deployment can
    run the "verify-with-legacy, re-derive-with-fixed, overwrite" migration
    recommended in the changelog without forking the old code.

        password:     Password bytes.
