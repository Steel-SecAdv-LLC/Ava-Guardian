/** DETECTED capability tier per subsystem, populated by ama_dispatch_init()
 * (read-only after init).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * Every field is the tier the CPU-feature detection ADMITS for that
 * subsystem.  It is NOT a report of the kernel the dispatcher ended up
 * wiring, and the two can differ.  Each field carried the word "Selected"
 * until 5.0.0, which was wrong in a way a caller could act on: a reader on a
 * host where the AES-GCM ISA bundle gate fails sees `aes_gcm = AMA_IMPL_AVX2`
 * and concludes hardware AES is running, while the table holds the
 * constant-time bitsliced path.  Measured on one process with
 * `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY=argon2-g-avx2` set: this struct reported
 * `aes_gcm = AVX2` while `ama_aes_gcm_active_backend()` reported
 * `bitsliced-software`.
 *
 * Detection and wiring diverge in four ways, all of them by design:
 *
 *   1. ISA-bundle gates.  AVX2 admits the AES-GCM tier, but the kernel also
 *      needs AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ; a hypervisor may advertise one without the
 *      others.  The same shape guards the ARMv8-CE path.
 *   2. Environment opt-outs — `AMA_DISPATCH_NO_CHACHA_AVX2`,
 *      `AMA_DISPATCH_NO_ARGON2_AVX2` and friends — which clear a pointer
 *      without changing what was detected.
 *   3. `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY=<slot>`, which clears the WHOLE table and re-wires
 *      one slot.
 *   4. The Phase-3 auto-tune, which reverts a slot whose SIMD kernel measured
 *      slower than its scalar reference on this host.
 *
 * Two of the nine fields — `sphincs` and `ed25519` — have no dispatch-table
 * slot at all, so for them "detected tier" is the only thing there is to
 * report.  That is the structural reason this struct is a detection record
 * rather than a wiring record.
 *
 * TO ASK WHAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING, use one of:
 *   - `ama_get_dispatch_table()` and NULL-check the slot you care about
 *     (a NULL slot means the portable path is in use);
 *   - `ama_aes_gcm_active_backend()`, which names the AES-GCM kernel by the
 *     pointer actually installed;
 *   - `ama_dispatch_active_slot()`, which reports the `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY`
 *     pin (or `"all-default-dispatch"`).
 *
 * ABI policy: append-only.  New fields land *after* `arch_name` so
 * binaries linked against older copies of this header still see the
 * same offset for every field they know about.  Reordering or
 * inserting fields earlier would silently break consumers compiled
 * against a previous release. */

 *  the formula every wired kernel computes.  Not [-q+1, q-1]: q itself
 *  is attainable, for the nine inputs that are exact negative multiples
 *  of q from -3329 down to -29961 (a == -q yields t == (v*-q)>>26 == -2
 *  via the arithmetic right shift, producing a - t*q == +q).  So the
 *  output is fully reduced except at that one value, and it is never
 *  negative: the truncating shift floors toward -infinity and therefore
 *  always undershoots the quotient.
 *
 *  This paragraph used to advertise [-2q, 2q] and "exactly +q (or -q)".
 *  The bound was 4x looser than the truth on the positive side and the
 *  "-q" half has no witness — no int16 input produces a negative output.
 *  A caller sizing an overflow margin or a canonicality argument from
 *  the old wording was reasoning about a range the function cannot
 *  reach, in both directions.  Callers needing a strictly canonical
 *  [0, q-1] must still follow with the FIPS 203 csubq / freeze step,
 *  which is what removes the single q.
 *
 *  Every wired kernel picks the SAME representative: the production
 *  scalar barrett_reduce() in src/c/ama_kyber.c, barrett_reduce_neon
 *  and the SVE2 barrett_reduce_scalar all compute
 *  `((v * a) >> 26) * q` with no rounding addend, and
 *  tests/c/test_kyber_poly_equiv.c compares them byte-for-byte.  An
 *  earlier revision of this paragraph said the SVE2 kernel used a
 *  *centered* Barrett with a `+ (1 << 25)` term and could therefore
 *  differ by exactly q; that kernel was corrected and this contract
 *  was not, so the sentence outlived the code it described — and the
 *  equivalence test had been loosened to a mod-q comparator on the

 *
 * Cache key — a deterministic string built from `arch_name`, the

 * `kyber`, `dilithium`, `aes_gcm`, `chacha20`, `argon2`, `x25519`,
 * `ed25519`, `sphincs` — each 0=Generic, 1=AVX2, 2=AVX-512, 3=NEON,

 * `avx512f`, `avx512kc`, `aesni`, `pclmul`, `vaes`, `kbmi`,
 * `arm_aes`, `arm_pmull`).  Key names match the emitted fingerprint string
 * verbatim — see `dispatch_cache_fingerprint()` in
 * `src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c`.  A kernel upgrade, microcode
 * change, or library version that re-wires which tier owns a slot
 * invalidates the cache automatically — no manual flush.
 * Mismatched fingerprints are treated as a cache miss; the bench
 * runs and rewrites the file.
 *
 * Security — the env var is HONOURED only when the process is not
 * setuid / setgid and not running under a kernel-flagged secure
 * exec context (issetugid() / AT_SECURE).  A privileged process
 * silently ignores the env var: an unprivileged user must not be
 * able to point a privileged binary at an attacker-controlled
 * cache path.  Cache files are created with mode 0600 (user-only).
 *
 * Default (env unset) — no file I/O on this code path, strictly opt-in.
 *
 * Permission / ownership contract: cache files are created with mode
 * 0600 and owned by the EUID that runs the writing process (the
 * canonical setuid env-var hardening — see `dispatch_cache_env_is_safe`
 * in `src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c`).  That makes
 * `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ama-cryptography/<file>` (i.e., per-user
 * `~/.cache/ama-cryptography/<file>` on a Linux/XDG host, or a
 * caller-chosen path under the process's HOME on Apple / BSD) the
 * recommended location: each user's processes can read/write their own
 * cache, and a privileged process never trusts an unprivileged caller's
 * env var (Copilot review #326 r3276471202).
 *
 * Distribution packagers wishing to ship a pre-warmed cache should
 * write per-target-user files under that user's `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`
 * (`install -m 0600 -o $user -g $user ...`) rather than a single
 * root-owned file under `/etc`: a non-root service running with
 * `AMA_DISPATCH_CACHE_FILE=/etc/ama-cryptography.cache` would be
 * unable to read a root-owned 0600 file (perpetual cache miss + a
 * verbose-log read-failure line per init) AND unable to atomically
 * `rename(2)` its own tmp file over a directory it doesn't own
 * (the writer side would log a write FAILED entry on every init).
 * See `src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c::dispatch_cache_save_at` for the
 * (text, one key=value per line) file format and forward-compatibility
 * behaviour.
 *
 * The cache is bypassed when `AMA_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOTUNE=1` is set — the
 * opt-out env var takes precedence and the bench is skipped without
 * any cache read or write.

/* ============================================================================
 * Per-slot dispatch isolation (audit Issue 3 close-out / INVARIANT-12)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY=<slot>` (read at `ama_dispatch_init()` time) leaves
 * every dispatch kernel pointer at its scalar fallback EXCEPT the named
 * slot, which is forced active if and only if the host supports it.
 * Lets the dudect SIMD sweep attribute a per-slot t-value to a single
 * kernel without interference from the rest of the dispatch table.
 *
 * Recognised slot names (must match the CHANGELOG inventory verbatim):
 *
 *   "sha3-avx512x4"        — keccak_f1600_x4 -> AVX-512 (vprolq + vpternlogq)
 *   "kyber-ntt-avx2"       — kyber_ntt / invntt / pointwise / cbd2 -> AVX2
 *   "dilithium-ntt-avx2"   — dilithium_ntt / invntt / pointwise / rej_uniform -> AVX2
 *   "chacha20-avx2x8"      — chacha20_block_x8 -> AVX2 8-way
 *   "argon2-g-avx2"        — argon2_g -> AVX2 BlaMka
 *   "aes-gcm-neon"         — aes_gcm_encrypt / decrypt -> ARMv8 AES + PMULL
 *   "chacha20-neon"        — chacha20_block_x8 -> NEON
 *   "sha3-neon"            — keccak_f1600 -> NEON
 *   "kyber-ntt-neon"       — kyber_ntt / invntt / pointwise -> NEON
 *   "dilithium-ntt-neon"   — dilithium_ntt / invntt / pointwise -> NEON
 *   "argon2-g-neon"        — argon2_g -> NEON BlaMka
 *   "kyber-sve2"           — kyber_ntt / invntt / pointwise / poly_{add,sub,reduce} -> SVE2
 *   "sha3-sve2"            — keccak_f1600 -> SVE2
 *   "x25519-avx2"          — x25519_x4 -> AVX2 4-way ladder
 *                            (requires AMA_DISPATCH_USE_X25519_AVX2=1 also set)
 *
 * `ama_dispatch_active_slot()` returns the resolved slot label on a
 * host that honored `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY`, or the literal string
 * `"all-default-dispatch"` on a host where `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY` was
 * unset OR set to a slot the host could not satisfy.  The returned
 * pointer is a string literal with static storage duration; do not
 * free it.
 *
 * A failing `AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY` request emits exactly one
 * unconditional `[AMA Dispatch] ERROR:` line on stderr (NOT gated
 * on `AMA_DISPATCH_VERBOSE`) and leaves every kernel pointer at
 * scalar fallback.  Two distinct error messages cover the two
 * failure modes:
 *
 *   UNRECOGNISED — the slot name is not in the inventory above.
 *                  The error line enumerates the known slot names
 *                  so an operator who fat-fingered the env var
 *                  sees the right spelling.
 *   UNSUPPORTED  — the slot name is known, but the host's CPU does
 *                  not satisfy it (or the build did not compile
 *                  the kernel).  The error line names the slot
 *                  and the cause class.
 *
 * `ama_dispatch_active_slot()` reports the `"all-default-dispatch"`
 * sentinel in either case, which the dudect test harness in
 * `tests/c/test_dispatch_only_env.c` interprets as a CTest skip
 * (exit code 77).
