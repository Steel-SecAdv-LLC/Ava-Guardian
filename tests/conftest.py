# =============================================================================
# When AMA_CI_REQUIRE_BACKENDS=1 is set (by our ci.yml after building the
# C library), all cryptographic backends MUST be available. Tests that skip
# due to missing backends become hard failures. This env var is NOT set by
# other CI workflows that may not build the native library, so their
# legitimate skips are preserved.

#: Instruction-set capabilities a test may declare with

#:
#: The CI escalation below turns a backend-shaped skip into a hard failure
#: because a backend missing after a build is a defect.  A test whose subject
#: is an instruction-set extension is a different case: on an aarch64 runner
#: there is no x86 AES-NI to be missing, and "build the C library" — what the
#: escalation tells the operator to do — is not a remedy.  Three x86-only
#: parametrisations of
#: ``tests/test_aesni_is_not_gated_on_avx2.py::TestTheBackendAcrossBuildConfigurations``
#: failed every ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest and macos-latest job that way:
#: the skip reason has to name AES-NI to be informative, and naming it is what
#: tripped ``_mentions_backend``.
#:
#: The exemption is deliberately NOT text-matched — "mentions x86" would let
#: any backend skip through by rewording.  A test must NAME a capability from
#: this table, and the hook then re-asks the host: on a host that HAS the
#: capability the skip is escalated exactly as before, so the marker cannot
#: hide a backend a build should have produced.  A token that is not in the
#: table is not an exemption either, so a typo fails closed.

    A test may carry several ``@pytest.mark.skipif`` decorators (for example
    ``TestAESGCMInterop`` has both ``@skip_no_native`` and ``@skip_no_pyca``).
    The skip we receive came from whichever marker's condition evaluated
    truthy at collection time; iterating ``item.iter_markers('skipif')``
    yields *all* of them regardless of which actually triggered, so we
    must re-check each marker's condition before treating it as the cause
    of the skip.  Without this scoping a test skipped for an unrelated
    reason (e.g. a broken PyCA install) would be incorrectly reported as
    a backend-missing failure because a sibling backend-related skipif
    happens to be attached to the same item.

    Marker inspection is not sufficient on its own.  An imperative
    ``pytest.skip("Kyber backend unavailable")`` — raised from a fixture or a
    test body, which is how several of the PQC KAT suites report a missing
    backend — attaches no marker to the item, so it passed straight through
    this hook and CI reported it as a skip.  That is the same
    escalation-shaped hole the ``skipif`` path exists to close, so the

    "All cryptographic backends must be available in CI" is a claim about what
