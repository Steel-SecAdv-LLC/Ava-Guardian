"""The container base-image gate must fail on the conditions it names.

``tools/check_docker_pins.py`` exists because two properties of the published
images were unchecked: the bases were pinned by mutable tag, and one of them
(``alpine:3.18``) had been past end-of-support for fifteen months. A gate for
either is worth nothing unless it can actually fail, so both directions are
exercised on purpose-built input as well as on the real tree.

The end-of-support half is checked against an injected date rather than the
system clock: a test that passes only until some future morning is not a test.

A third property lives here because this gate is what moved the base: when
``alpine:3.18`` was bumped to ``alpine:3.23`` for end-of-support,
``ENHANCED_FEATURES.md`` kept printing ``FROM alpine:3.18`` in its "Alpine-based
Image" example. Nothing compared the two, so the document went on describing a
base the project had already left. Every ``FROM`` line a tracked document shows
must now name a base one of the tracked Dockerfiles actually uses.
