Tests for the fuzz target registration verifier
(``tools/check_fuzz_target_registration.py``).

A fuzz harness is registered in three independent places — the CMake target
lists, the ``fuzzing.yml`` job matrix, and ``oss-fuzz/build.sh`` — and nothing
tied them together.  ``build.sh`` even carries a "keep in sync" comment and had
drifted anyway: ``fuzz_agent_binding`` was added to CMake and to the CI matrix
and never to ``build.sh``, so OSS-Fuzz never built it.  ``build.sh`` skips a
missing target with a warning and exits 0, which is why it stayed invisible.

Both directions are pinned here, because a checker that only ever reports
"clean" is indistinguishable from one that has stopped working.  The
non-detection cases matter as much as the detection ones: the first draft of
this checker produced three false positives, and each would have pushed a
maintainer to "fix" a repository that was already correct.
