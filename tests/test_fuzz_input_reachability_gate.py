"""Tests for ``tools/check_fuzz_input_reachability.py``.

The gate exists because a fuzz target can be registered in every lane, run on
every trigger, report green, and never enter the branch it was written for.
libFuzzer never generates a unit longer than ``-max_len`` and — measured on
this tree — truncates corpus units to it as well: a 60,001-byte seed loaded
under ``-max_len=4096`` enters the in-memory corpus at 4,096 bytes.  So a
guard above the ceiling is unreachable by construction, not merely unlikely.

Two harnesses were in exactly that state against the hard-coded
``-max_len=4096``: ``fuzz_dilithium`` case 1 (5,262 bytes) and
``fuzz_sphincs`` cases 1 and 2 (49,921 and 49,857).

Every case below is a mutation: the gate must reject a guard above the
ceiling, an unresolved guard that is not declared, and a ``-max_len`` written
into the workflow by hand — and must accept the tree as it stands.
