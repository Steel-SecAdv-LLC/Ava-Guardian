"""Negative controls for ``tools/check_suppression_hygiene.py``'s optional-import pass.

INVARIANT-13's third-party-import pass exists for one hazard: a bare
``# type: ignore`` on the fallback assignment of a guarded optional import::

    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        np = None  # type: ignore[assignment]

is *required* on a machine where the package is installed and an *error* under
``warn_unused_ignores`` on one where it is not, so the verdict depends on the
environment rather than on the code.

The pass reached that shape through a substring pre-filter, ``"ImportError" not
in source``, and ``"ModuleNotFoundError"`` does not contain ``"ImportError"``.
So a file guarded with the ``ModuleNotFoundError`` spelling was dropped before
it was ever parsed — while :func:`_third_party_import_fallback_lines`, the AST
pass behind the filter, has always accepted both spellings.  The gate reported
clean on exactly the files it could not see.

This pass had no tests, which is how that survived.  The MODULE was not
untested — ``tests/test_invariant_upgrades.py`` covers the first pass
(``check_source``, ``effective_suppressions``, ``main``) and the second
(``scan_c_tree``, ``c_tree_files``) in both directions — it touches neither
``scan_optional_imports`` nor ``_third_party_import_fallback_lines``.  Two
passes of three read as a covered tool.
