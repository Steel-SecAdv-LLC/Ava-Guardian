"""Negative controls for the Semgrep severity gate (``tools/check_semgrep_severity.py``).

The step this replaces could not fail. The CI job ran::

    semgrep --config .semgrep.yml ama_cryptography/ --json -o semgrep-report.json

``semgrep scan`` exits 0 whether or not it finds anything unless ``--error`` is
passed, and nothing ever read ``semgrep-report.json``. So the merge-blocking
"Semgrep security scan" step was a green light wired to nothing: a file that
trips the config's own ERROR-severity rules — ``insecure-random-usage``,
``weak-hash-algorithm``, ``deprecated-cryptography-api``, ``private-key-logging``,
``unsafe-pickle-usage``, ``bare-memset-zero-secret-named-buffer`` — still exited 0.

Replacing a broken gate with a working one is only worth anything if the new one
demonstrably goes red on bad input, so these are negative controls first:

1. a finding at or above the ERROR floor must fail;
2. WARNING- and INFO-severity findings (the config's constant-time and
   hardcoded-secret advisories) must pass — they are tracked, not merge-blocking;
3. every "the scan did not actually run over the tree" condition must fail closed
   rather than read as a clean tree;
4. the config's declared ERROR rules must be exactly the severities the gate
   blocks on, so the two cannot drift apart silently;
5. the workflow must actually invoke the tool, on the report the scan wrote, with
   nothing swallowing the gate's exit code.
