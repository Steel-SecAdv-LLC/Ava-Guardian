"""A notifier callback must not mask a failing key-rotation mechanism.

``_trigger_rotation`` OR-ed a single ``succeeded`` flag across the KMS-backed
``rotation_manager`` AND the ``on_rotation`` notifier.  If the KMS raised
(``register_key`` / ``initiate_rotation``) but a configured ``on_rotation()``
returned normally, ``succeeded`` was ``True``: the cooldown armed, the failure
streak cleared, and ``get_posture_summary()['rotation_suspended']`` stayed
``False`` — so
``MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ROTATION_FAILURES`` never tripped even though NO key ever
rotated.  The docstring frames ``on_rotation`` as a notifier, so "notifier
healthy, KMS broken" is a realistic deployment.

The fix tracks the key-rotating mechanism separately: a notifier can only
confirm success when the KMS-backed rotation did not fail; a KMS failure now
dominates so the streak accrues and the cap eventually trips.  Callback-only
deployments (no ``rotation_manager``) keep counting the callback as the
mechanism.
