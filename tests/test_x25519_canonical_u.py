Regression pins for X25519 non-canonical u-coordinate handling (INVARIANT-27).

RFC 7748 §5 `decodeUCoordinate` masks bit 255 of a received u-coordinate
and stops there, so a decoded value can land anywhere in [0, 2^255). Since
p = 2^255 - 19, nineteen of those values — [p, 2^255) — are representable
but not canonical: each denotes a field element that has a smaller
encoding too. The RFC then does arithmetic mod p, so the element such an
encoding names is unambiguously `u mod p`.

All three field paths in `src/c/ama_x25519.c` masked the top bit and never
reduced, so a u in that band was consumed unreduced and produced a shared
secret that no other implementation computes. Wycheproof x25519 **tc88** is
exactly this case: its u is `p + 3`.

The RFC does not *require* the reduction — Wycheproof scores the case
`acceptable` — so this is an interoperability decision, taken in favour of
reducing. The failure mode of not reducing is bad out of proportion to how
rare it is: two peers holding the same public key derive different shared
secrets and the handshake fails with nothing to point at.

These tests pin the decision so it cannot be reverted by accident. The
second group pins the *other* X25519 policy the corpus exercises: an
all-zero shared secret is rejected rather than returned (RFC 7748 §6.1).
