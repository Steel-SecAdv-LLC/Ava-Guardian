Unit tests for tools/check_headers.py.

Two jobs, mirroring tests/test_version_consistency.py:

  * the real tree must be clean, so the CI gate has a durable
    steady state to defend; and
  * a synthetic tree carrying each of the *wrong* header shapes the
    repository used to contain must be flagged, and must normalize to
    the canonical two-line form — so the scanner is known to be able
    to fail, not merely known to pass.

The stale shapes exercised below are the ones that were actually in
the tree before normalization: the two-line "Licensed under the Apache
License, Version 2.0" note, the thirteen-line Apache boilerplate block,
the C block-comment variants of both, the one-off "Apache License 2.0"
spelling, and a file with no header at all.
