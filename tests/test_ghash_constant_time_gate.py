"""Negative controls for ``tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py``.

This gate shipped without any. INVARIANT-2 states the consequence in as many
words — *"a gate with no negative control has not been shown to be a gate at
all"* — and the consequence arrived on schedule.

``_measure`` (then named ``_instruction_count``) parsed callgrind's
``I refs:`` line and never looked at the driver's exit status. Callgrind
prints that line for any process it supervises, including one that dies in
the dynamic loader before reaching
``main``. Handing ``--lib`` a shared object rather than the static archive did
exactly that: the driver linked, failed to load, and every key class returned
the same ~109,000 instructions of loader work. All classes agreed, the delta
was zero, and the gate printed::

    ECDSA CONSTANT-TIME CHECK PASSED — count is key-independent.

over a program that had performed no cryptography. It printed the same verdict
for a build carrying two live secret-dependent branches in
``src/c/ama_secp256k1.c`` and for a build with none — which is the definition
of a gate that gates nothing.

So the properties pinned here are, in order of what actually failed:

1. **A driver that did not run is INCONCLUSIVE, never PASS.** Both the
   exit-status rule in ``_measure`` and its propagation to the exit
   code of ``main``.
2. **The verdict arithmetic.** Above threshold fails, below passes, and an
   unusable noise floor is inconclusive rather than either.
3. **The calibration is not decorative.** The ECDSA threshold must stay small
   enough to catch the class of defect that was getting through at 3,000 —
   which, measured on the archive build CI uses, spread 2,952 against an old
   threshold of 3,000.
4. **The sampling cannot silently collapse.** Key classes must be distinct
   single-byte ASCII: a non-ASCII character is UTF-8 encoded by the caller and
   the driver would see only the lead byte, so two "different" classes could
   become one and the check would compare a key against itself.
5. **The drivers must not use degenerate key material.** ``memset``-ing one
   byte across the key caps the sampled key space at 256 highly structured
   values.
6. **CI must actually invoke both targets.**
7. **An unoptimized library is INCONCLUSIVE, never PASS.** Every target here
   looks for a transformation the optimizer performs, so at ``-O0`` there is
   nothing to find. The gate ran that way in CI for the life of this branch —
   ``dudect.yml`` configured CMake with no ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` and this
   project defines no default, so the archive carried no ``-O`` flag at all —
   and behind that, ``--target ecdsa`` at ``-O3`` was measuring a
   9,424-instruction key-dependent spread in ``sc_mont_mul``.
8. **A secret-dependent memory ACCESS fails even when the instruction count
   does not move.** An instruction count cannot see a table lookup indexed by
   a secret; the data-reference and cache-miss figures can.

    A deterministic instrument that reserves a benign band it does not need
    has bought the right to pass a real divergence of that size. Measured on
    the AMA_TESTING_MODE static archive at -O3 under both compilers CI uses,
    all eighteen targets have a cross-class delta of exactly zero and a
    same-class floor of exactly zero. ``ecdsa`` was the last to carry a benign
    term — the DER encoding of the public r and s — and reached zero by
    signing through a fixed-width entry point rather than by tolerating it.

    ``secp256k1-scalarmult`` is the fourteenth, added because the dudect lane
    for that ladder was information-only and the file its comment named as
    carrying the "fail-loud variant" contains no secp256k1 scalar-multiplication
    case: a 256-step Montgomery ladder over a secret scalar was covered only by
    a lane that cannot fail CI. Measured at limit 0 on all four metrics —
    16,020,324 instruction references and 3,835,722 data references,
    byte-identical across all eight classes, with identical D1 and LL misses.

    ``consttime-lookup``, ``consttime-swap``, ``consttime-copy`` and
    ``secure-memzero`` are the fifteenth through eighteenth: the strict
    wall-clock lanes for the constant-time utility primitives live in the
    sub-floor range (the five-run floor re-measurement in 8abb0ed read
    ``ama_consttime_lookup`` between −0.021 and +0.056 ns in all five runs),
    where the wall-clock test abstains by design and, until these targets
    existed, nothing deterministic stood behind the abstention — the gap
    e46906c closed for ``ascon-encrypt`` and ``agent-binding``, recurring
    for the lanes nobody re-checked. Measured byte-identical across all
    eight classes on all four metrics under both compilers (gcc 13 /
    clang 18 I refs: lookup 99,715,167 / 99,730,903; swap 98,548,267 /

    19,761,950), same-class floor 0. Each gate is verified to FAIL rather
    than assumed to work: an early return planted on ``ama_consttime_swap``'s
    condition reported an 81,930,000-instruction cross-class delta and exit
    1, and an index-dependent scan truncation planted in
    ``ama_consttime_lookup`` reported 54,488,000 and exit 1; both mutations
