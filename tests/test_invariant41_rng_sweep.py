"""INVARIANT-41: every bare RNG draw in the shipped package is accounted for.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
INVARIANT-41 routes key material, nonces, and every identifier a key
derivation consumes through ``secure_token_bytes`` — the wrapper that runs
the FIPS 140-3 §4.9.2 continuous stuck-DRBG check and refuses in the ERROR
state.  The invariant was enforced by hand-sweeping the package for bare
``secrets.token_bytes`` / ``os.urandom`` calls and fixing what the sweep
found.  That sweep missed ``secure_channel.py`` entirely: at ``origin/main``
the file contained no reference to ``secure_token_bytes`` at all, and both of
its draws were bare — the AEAD nonce and the responder-side handshake session
ID, the latter signed into the transcript and consumed by ``_derive_session``.

(This paragraph used to say the sweep "missed exactly one site … while the
initiator side of the very same protocol drew through the health-tested
wrapper".  Neither half was true: the initiator does not generate a session ID
at all — it receives one from the peer — and no draw in the file went through
the wrapper before this branch.  A false account of how a control came to be
needed is a bad reason to trust the control.)

A hand sweep that must be re-run perfectly after every change is not a
control; this module is the control.

What it enforces
----------------
Every call site of a bare OS-entropy draw in ``ama_cryptography/`` must be
on the allowlist below, and every allowlist entry must still exist.  The
allowlist names its reasons: an entry is either the health-tested wrapper's
own entropy source, the POST stage that tests the RNG, a build-time context
where POST is structurally unavailable, or a draw whose output is not
security-load-bearing.  Demo code under ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` is
exempt — it never runs on import and models caller code, not library code.

Both directions are pinned: the sweep must flag a bare draw added to a
shipped code path (``test_the_sweep_can_fail``), and must not flag the
``__main__`` demo form (``test_main_guard_is_exempt``).

#: The list is the whole of the sweep's reach, so an omission is not a smaller

#: nonce with ``secrets.randbits(64)`` — the value the code itself calls "the
#: client's only way to tell a fresh response from a replayed one" — outside
#: the health test, outside the allowlist, and structurally invisible to the
#: gate that promises to enumerate "every bare draw".  Both now draw through
#: ``secure_token_bytes``.
#:
#: ``secrets.randbits`` IS ``SystemRandom.getrandbits``; ``token_hex`` and
#: ``token_urlsafe`` are ``token_bytes`` with an encoding on top; ``choice``
#: and ``getrandbits`` are the same generator through a different accessor.
#: None of them is a weaker draw — they are the same draw, spelled differently,
#: which is precisely why a name-based sweep has to name them all.
