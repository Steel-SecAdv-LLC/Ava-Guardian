Adversarial agentic-load scenarios
==================================

The four scenarios from the July-2026 agent-escape pattern, driven end to end
against the real primitives with the 3R monitors running:

  1. ``TestHighConcurrencyAgenticLoad`` — 100-500 threads generating ephemeral
     ML-KEM-1024 keypairs and ML-DSA-65 signatures in tight loops while the
     volume-spike detector runs.  Asserts the detector fires only above its
     calibrated thresholds, that the monitor's own bookkeeping survives the
     concurrency, and (dudect-style) that the agent-binding verdict path shows
     no measurable timing dependence on the verdict under that load.

  2. ``TestFutureVersionNoteSimulation`` — synthetic "instructions for later
     instances" signed under an agent-instance binding.  Asserts the ethical
     binding refuses long-lived persistence material and that the note-like
     detector surfaces the artefact.

  3. ``TestLateralProbeSimulation`` — internal reconnaissance followed by a
     sudden pivot to external-key activity.  Asserts the 3R Resonance
     component registers the temporal anomaly, that it separates a probe from
     aperiodic traffic by a wide margin on data whose signal is controlled,
     and that real BIP32 HD derivation and real scheduled key rotation run
     through the monitor without reaching CRITICAL.

  4. ``TestFailClosedUnderLoad`` — forcing unbound persistence material from
     many threads at once must abort cleanly every single time.

These are slower than a unit test by construction; the thread counts are kept
at the low end of the 100-500 band by default and raised by the
``AMA_AGENTIC_LOAD_THREADS`` environment variable for a deeper local run.

        This is the false-positive test that matters, and the trap it has to

        ``assert alerts == []`` holds by arithmetic — the Anscombe residual is
        negative — no matter what the detector's calibration is.  (The earlier
        form of this test did exactly that: it warmed at 4x the probe rate and

        on.)

        the detector silent is that it has learned the traffic's natural

        structural path inside ``ama_agent_binding_check``, so a class
        separation would be a real leak in the verdict.
        ``tests/c/test_dudect.c`` runs the rigorous version at the C level with

        this lane adds the condition an agent would
        actually create — other threads competing for the CPU — and checks the
        property still holds when the call is reached through ctypes.

        The native entry point is called directly rather than through
        :meth:`AgentBinding.is_permitted`.  That wrapper raises and catches an
        exception on refusal, so the *Python* around the check is inherently

        the primitive, and would report a leak that is not there.  Everything

        — is prepared before the loop, so the timed region is one FFI call.

    # -- where the resonance claim is asserted, and why -------------------
    #
    # The security property is: the Resonance component tells a reconnaissance
    # probe (a tight periodic loop) apart from legitimate traffic.  Two earlier
    # forms of this test tried to assert that from WALL-CLOCK timings of real
    # sub-millisecond operations, and both were really measuring the runner:
    #
    #   1. `hd_ratio * 5 < probe_ratio` against a fixed bar — read ~4 on Linux,
    #      13.3 on macOS, and failed there on scheduler noise alone.
    #   2. A surrogate-data comparison against the series' own shuffles.  That
    #      removed the machine-noise dependence correctly, and then found what
    #      it was built to find: real workloads on real machines genuinely DO
    #      carry periodic timing structure.  HD derivation scored 2.91x on
    #      macOS because the FIRST derivation under each account pays a cache
    #      warm-up (~2.3x locally) and the harness marched 4 accounts x 24
    #      indices in lockstep — a period-24 line the harness itself created.
    #      Key registration scored 2.10x on Windows for the same class of
    #      reason (allocator/resize spikes as the table grows).
    #
    # So "legitimate work never resonates" is not a true statement about real
    # timings, and no threshold makes it one.  Wall-clock periodicity of a
    # sub-millisecond operation on a shared runner is not a sound instrument
    # for a CI gate.
    #
    # The claim is therefore asserted where it can be measured honestly:
    # `test_resonance_separates_probe_from_legitimate_traffic` drives the
    # detector with SYNTHETIC sequences — deterministic, no clock — and holds
    # it to a wide margin, including a surrogate check in both directions.
    # The real-workload tests below keep running real BIP32 derivation and real
    # key rotation through the monitor and assert what is genuinely robust:
    # legitimate work raises no CRITICAL anomaly (the alert level that would
    # page a human) and the monitor ingests real timings correctly.
    #
    # Surrogate machinery (shuffling destroys temporal ordering while
    # preserving the exact multiset of values, hence the noise level) is kept
