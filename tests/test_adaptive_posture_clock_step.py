"""A backward wall-clock step must not permanently wedge the adaptive posture.

The cooldown, grace-period, retry-backoff and alert-scoring cursor all did
wall-clock duration arithmetic.
A backward step (NTP step, VM snapshot restore, container clock adjustment) made
``now - stored`` negative, which read as "still in cooldown" / "grace not
elapsed" forever and silently muted protective actions and blinded alert
scoring for the step's duration. The fix re-anchors a stored timestamp left in
the future by a regression, converting a permanent wedge into a bounded delay.
