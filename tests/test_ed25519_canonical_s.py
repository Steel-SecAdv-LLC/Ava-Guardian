Ed25519 canonical-S enforcement (RFC 8032 §5.1.7) — INVARIANT-26.

RFC 8032 §5.1.7 requires a verifier to decode the second half of a signature
as an integer ``S`` in the range ``0 <= S < L`` and to reject the signature if
that decoding fails.  ``L`` is the order of the base point::

    L = 2**252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493

Neither of this project's two Ed25519 backends enforced that range, and
Wycheproof ``eddsa_verify_schema_v1`` found it:

    tc63  "checking malleability"                  SignatureMalleability
    tc85  "Signature with S just above the bound"  InvalidKtv

Both must be rejected; both verified as VALID.

* The vendored x86-64 path the tree then carried (removed in the twenty-first
  maintenance pass) tested only ``RS[63] & 224`` — i.e. it rejected
  ``S >= 2**253``.  ``L`` sits just above
  ``2**252``, so the whole band ``L <= S < 2**253`` slipped through, and that
  band is exactly where ``S + L`` lands for most signatures.
* The portable **fe51** path (``ama_ed25519.c``) performed no range check at
  all, and its scalar-multiply reduces mod ``L`` internally, so ``S`` and
  ``S + L`` produced the identical point.

The consequence is signature malleability: given any valid ``(R, S)``, anyone
can emit ``(R, S + L)`` — a different 64-byte string that also verifies —
without touching the private key.  Systems that treat signature bytes as an
identity (dedup caches, replay windows, content addressing, transaction ids)
see two distinct "signatures" for one authenticated message.

These tests construct the malleable form directly from a freshly generated
signature rather than replaying a fixed vector, so they keep working if the
key generator, the hash, or the backend changes.  The Wycheproof corpus is run
separately; this file is the targeted regression pin.
