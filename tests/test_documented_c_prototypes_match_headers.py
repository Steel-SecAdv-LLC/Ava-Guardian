"""Every C prototype the documentation prints must be the one the header declares.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS

``wiki/C-API-Reference.md`` is the page a C consumer reads before writing a line
against this library, and nothing checked it against ``include/ama_cryptography.h``.
It had drifted until **33 of its 38 declarations were wrong**.  Four named
functions that do not exist (``ama_random_bytes``, ``ama_kyber_enc``,
``ama_kyber_dec``, ``ama_shake256_inc_ctx_release``) and ten macros that do not
exist (the ``AMA_DILITHIUM_*``, ``AMA_KYBER_*`` and ``AMA_SPHINCS_*`` size
families), so the examples could not compile at all.  Those fail loudly.

The dangerous ones compiled:

* ``ama_ed25519_keypair(uint8_t pk[32], uint8_t sk[32])`` — the secret key is
  **64** bytes (RFC 8032 expanded form, ``AMA_ED25519_SECRET_KEY_BYTES``).  A
  reader who sized that buffer from the wiki overflowed it by 32 bytes on every
  keypair and every sign.
* Both AEADs were documented as ``(plaintext, pt_len, aad, aad_len, key, nonce,
  ...)``.  The real order is ``(key, nonce, plaintext, pt_len, aad, aad_len,
  ...)``.  Every one of those parameters is a ``const uint8_t *``, so a caller
  following the wiki passes the plaintext where the key belongs and the compiler
  says nothing.
* ``ama_dilithium_verify`` and ``ama_sphincs_verify`` were documented as
  ``(signature, signature_len, message, message_len, public_key)``.  The real
  order is message first.  Also silent.
* ``ama_consttime_swap`` and ``ama_consttime_copy`` were documented with
  ``condition`` last; it is first.

WHAT IT ENFORCES

Every prototype-shaped declaration inside a ```c fence, in every tracked ``.md``
file, must match a declaration in a real header verbatim after whitespace and
pointer-spacing normalisation.  Parameter names are compared too: these are
reference pages, and a reader who copies ``uint8_t sk[32]`` out of one is
copying a claim about size, not a stylistic choice.

The C API page is not the only one that makes the promise:
``wiki/Cryptography-Algorithms.md`` prints the Argon2id legacy shim's two
prototypes and had drifted from the header the same way, calling ``parallelism``
``p_cost`` and ``output`` ``out``.

A declaration whose header is not under ``include/`` must be listed in
:data:`INTERNAL_HEADER_DOCUMENTED`, whose value names the header it comes from.
There is exactly one, and the page says out loud that the public header does not
declare it.
