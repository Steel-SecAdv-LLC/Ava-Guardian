"""``nist_vectors/run_vectors.py`` must find the library at any SONAME.

The harness named its versioned fallback literally::

    lib_names = ["libama_cryptography.so", "libama_cryptography.so.2"]

``CMakeLists.txt`` sets ``SOVERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR}``, so that string
went stale the moment 3.0.0 shipped and had been wrong for three majors by
5.0.0.  It never bit because CI builds in-tree, where the unversioned symlink
exists and is tried first — but on any layout carrying only the versioned
object (an installed prefix, a packaged sysroot, a wheel's bundled library)
the harness would report that it could not find the library while the library
sat beside it under its current name.

A validation harness that cannot find the library reports a *build* failure,
not a vector failure, which is the misdiagnosis worth removing.  Re-pinning
the constant to ``.so.5`` would only restart the same clock, so discovery is
derived from what is present.

These tests deliberately do not name a major.  A test asserting ``.so.5``
would itself need editing at 6.0.0 — the defect it is meant to prevent.
