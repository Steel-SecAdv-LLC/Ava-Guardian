FIPS 140-3 POST fail-closed behaviour
=====================================

Regression coverage for a family of defects that shared one shape: the module
detected its own failure, said so in the log, and then reported success to
everything that could act on it.

Concretely, before this suite existed:

* ``ama_cryptography/__init__.py`` discarded the return value of ``_post()``.
  POST could log ``CRITICAL: FIPS 140-3 POST FAILURE: ...``, set the module
  state to ERROR, and ``import ama_cryptography`` still succeeded with exit
  code 0.  Every build script and health check that treated a clean import as
  proof of a working module reported success over a module that had just
  announced its own failure.

* Not one of the eighty public native entry points in ``pqc_backends`` checked
  the module state, so the FIPS §4.9.2 "error state" inhibited no cryptographic
  output at all outside ``crypto_api``.

* A native library that could not be found was reported as
  ``native Ed25519 not built``, sending operators to fix a C build that was
  usually fine.

* A checkout with no native backend imported cleanly with a warning, skipping
  eight of eleven self-tests — the "warning without a hard stop" that
  INVARIANT-7 names as unacceptable.

Import-level behaviour is exercised in subprocesses because it cannot be
observed from inside a process that has already imported the package.

        Without a lock this is a check-then-act race: threads A and B both read
        the same stale ``previous``, both compare their identical stuck value
        against it, both pass, and two consecutive identical outputs are issued
        as key material with the control silently satisfied.

        Eight threads on a ``Barrier`` are not enough to produce that
        interleaving, and this test used to be exactly that.  The health digest
        is computed BEFORE the critical section, so the unlocked check-then-act
        window is about five pure-Python bytecodes; under the GIL a switch
        lands inside it essentially never.  Measured against a build with
        ``_rng_lock`` removed: 60 consecutive runs of the eight-thread
        scenario, 0 failures.  The test asserted a property it could not
        observe, and the branch's own description of it — "reverting the lock
        makes all 8 threads receive the stuck value" — was false.

        The window is now held open from inside, by instrumenting the state
        the critical section reads rather than the code that reads it:
        ``_rng_state`` is replaced with a mapping whose first eight reads of
        ``previous`` rendezvous on a barrier before returning.  With the lock,
        one thread is inside and the other seven are queued on the lock, so
        that barrier can never fill and times out — one success, seven
        refusals.  Without the lock, all eight are inside together, the
        barrier fills immediately, all eight read ``None`` and all eight are
        issued the identical stuck buffer.  The two outcomes are structurally
        different rather than probabilistically different, which is what makes
        this an assertion instead of a hope.

        The timeout is the only cost, and it is paid only on the correct
