3R agentic-abuse detectors — behaviour, calibration and kernel equivalence
==========================================================================

Two detectors are under test:

  * :class:`VolumeSpikeDetector` — bursts of KEM/signature operations, scored
    in the Anscombe transform.  The tests that matter are the ones that assert
    it *does not* fire: on smooth traffic, on a ramp, on a small absolute
    burst, and before its warmup is complete.
  * :class:`NoteArtifactDetector` — signed payloads that read as instructions
    for a later instance.  Its calibration is re-derived here against this
    repository's own text corpus rather than asserted from a magic number.

Both detectors have a compiled kernel and a pure-Python twin.  The equivalence
tests pin them together so the extension stays an optimisation.

    """Corpus text with the checkout's line-ending convention removed.

    The detector scans at most ``max_scan_bytes`` (8 KiB by default), sampling
    head and tail for anything larger.  For a file bigger than that window,
    *which* text lands inside it is a function of every preceding byte — so a
    line terminator that is one octet on one platform and two on another does
    not merely re-encode the corpus, it changes which part of each large
    document is scored at all.

    That is a real failure and it was observed, not imagined: with
    ``core.autocrlf=true`` (git's default on Windows) ``IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md``
    scores 1.50 on a LF checkout and 1.25 on a CRLF one, purely because 1,343
    terminators grew a byte each and pushed a marker out of the sampled tail.
    The 1.50-admits-one-more-file calibration below then cannot hold, and all
    ten Windows CI jobs failed on a detector, document and threshold that were
    all correct.

    ``.gitattributes`` marks the tree ``-text`` so checkouts are byte-identical
    everywhere, and ``tools/check_line_endings.py`` keeps it that way.  This
    normalisation is the second half of that fix rather than a substitute for
    it: it makes the calibration a property of the corpus's *content*, so it
    holds under any checkout configuration, including one predating the
    attribute.  The detector itself deliberately does **not** normalise — it
    scores the payload it is handed, and a note that arrives with CRLF is still
    a note.
