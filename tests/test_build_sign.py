Tests for ama_cryptography._build_sign (release-pipeline integrity signer).

Covers the four PR #306 review comments:
  - _load_native_trust_anchor wraps the ctypes call + decode + hex parse
    inside try/except and normalises every failure to RuntimeError so the
    CLI's main() exception handler can render a clean one-line error.
  - main() catches Exception (not just RuntimeError) so an unexpected
    ctypes / OSError exits 1 with a stable failure message rather than a
    raw traceback.
  - _generate_keypair_and_sign returns the actual anchor source so the CLI
    can label the build "native" / "env" / "none" instead of guessing
    from the env var only.
