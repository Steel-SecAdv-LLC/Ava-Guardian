"""Tests for ``tools/check_vector_provenance.py``.

The incident: this repository's own pre-commit hooks rewrote its test
vectors.  The KAT format spells an empty field as a key followed by a
trailing space, so ``trailing-whitespace`` turned ``PT = `` into ``PT =``
across ML-KEM (FIPS 203), ML-DSA (FIPS 204), SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) and Ascon —
19 files no longer matching what NIST published.

What made it worth a gate: **nothing detected it**.  On the rewritten tree
the corpus generators' ``--check``, ``check_corpus_originality.py``,
``check_vendor_isolation.py`` and all 135 KAT tests still passed.

The gate was verified against that exact corruption rather than a mock: the
whitespace strip was reapplied to ``tests/kat/ascon/ascon_aead128.kat``, and
the gate failed naming the file and the 260,253 -> 260,220 byte delta.  The
mutation was reverted.

ANCHOR_DIGESTS below is the part that does not live in the manifest.  A
manifest committed alongside the files it pins can be regenerated to match
corrupted files; these assertions sit in the test source, so regenerating the
manifest alone leaves them failing.
