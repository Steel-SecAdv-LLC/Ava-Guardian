"""
The ctypes ABI contract gate (INVARIANT-42, static half)
========================================================

Two directions.  The repository must pass its own gate — every assigned
ctypes signature agrees with the C header prototype for that symbol.  And the
gate must be able to *fail*: each defect class it exists to catch (an arity
change, a pointer/integer confusion, a misread return convention, a called
symbol with no declared signature, a signature for an undeclared symbol) is
demonstrated on synthetic input.  A gate whose rejection direction is never
exercised is a green light wired to nothing.
