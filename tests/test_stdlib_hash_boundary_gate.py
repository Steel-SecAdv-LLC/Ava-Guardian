"""
Pins for tools/check_stdlib_hash_boundary.py — the INVARIANT-1 hashlib gate.

The gate's claim: every ``hashlib`` / ``_hashlib`` reference in the shipped
package sits inside a pinned, rationale-carrying trust-bootstrap allowlist,
so OpenSSL-backed stdlib hashing cannot quietly re-enter a production path.
A gate is only as good as its failure modes, so each is driven here: the
clean tree passes, a use outside the allowlist fails, growth inside an
allowlisted file fails, a stale allowlist entry fails, and docstring/comment
mentions do not count.
