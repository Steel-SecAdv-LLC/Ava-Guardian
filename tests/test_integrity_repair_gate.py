"""Which integrity failures ``AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`` may import through.

``ama_cryptography.__init__`` raises on a failed POST, with one carve-out: the
tools that REPAIR a failed integrity check live inside the package, so a hard
raise would wall them off behind the very fault they exist to clear.  The
carve-out is supposed to cover only the outcomes a signing run legitimately
expects in a tree it is about to re-sign.

Its integrity half did not narrow anything.  The condition read

    _integrity_stage_failed = any(name == "integrity" and ok is False for ...)
    ...
    (name == "integrity" and _integrity_stage_failed)

and the failing row is itself the witness that makes the ``any()`` true, so the
conjunct reduced to ``name == "integrity"``: every integrity failure qualified,
including "Ed25519 signature did NOT verify — module tampered".  A release
container carrying the flag for its whole lifetime — the scenario the comment
names — could smoke-test a wheel whose signature did not verify and exit 0,
which is the "failure in the log, success in the exit code" fail-open the block
exists to close.

The distinction is now carried structurally by
``_self_test.integrity_failure_was_stale_binding()``, the counterpart of
``pqc_backends.native_backend_refused_on_digest()``, and these tests pin both
directions of it plus the binding-strength downgrade that shares the machinery.

        is why this one had to start driving the real thing.

        The carve-out is for the signing TOOL, not for every process that
        happens to run in an environment where the variable is set — a
        Dockerfile ``ENV``, a CI environment, a systemd unit.  While the gate
        read the variable directly, an attacker with write access to the
        installed tree could edit any module imported after POST, have the
        resulting .py digest mismatch classified as a repairable stale
        binding, and get every such process to complete the import with exit
        0 while POST had failed.  Nothing had to be run; the variable was
        already there.

        Same tree, same fault, same variable as the test above — only the
        process identity differs, so a pass here and there together say the
        gate discriminates on identity and on nothing else.
