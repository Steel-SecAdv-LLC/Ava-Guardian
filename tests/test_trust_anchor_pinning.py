"""Trust-anchor pinning for package verification and the Noise-NK handshake.

Both APIs previously verified a signature against a public key that travelled
inside the very message being checked, so the check proved self-consistency
rather than origin: an adversary could mint a keypair, sign content of their
choosing, and produce an artefact that verified.  These tests pin the fix:

  * ``verify_crypto_package`` accepts an out-of-band ``expected_public_key``,
    compares it in constant time, fails closed on mismatch, and publishes
    which mode ran via the ``key_pinned`` result key (INVARIANT-37 — the
    boundary is data, not prose).
  * ``SecureChannelInitiator`` accepts ``expected_responder_sig_pk`` and
    rejects a handshake response carrying any other signature key.

The unpinned paths are asserted to keep their previous behaviour so the fix
stays backwards compatible.
