"""Non-canonical Ed25519 public-key ``y`` rejection (INVARIANT-38).

RFC 8032 §5.1.3 requires a compressed point whose ``y`` is not in ``[0, p)``
with ``p = 2^255 - 19`` to be **rejected**, not reduced. INVARIANT-27 already
recorded that rule — it is why X25519's canonicalisation sits on the 32-byte
encoding rather than inside the ``fe51_frombytes`` / ``fe64_frombytes``
helpers those two curves share — but neither backend enforced it: both reduced
mod ``p``, so each of the nineteen values in ``[p, 2^255)`` decoded to the same
curve point as its reduced counterpart and a public key had two accepted byte
encodings.

Why this module was rewritten
-----------------------------
Its first version drove every assertion through ``native_ed25519_verify``,
passing a non-canonical ``y`` as the public key alongside a signature made by
a *different* keypair. Those assertions were **vacuous**: verify returns False
for the wrong-key reason whether or not the canonical-``y`` rule exists, so
all thirty-eight of them passed with the check fully removed. Demonstrably so
— the canonical values ``y = 0`` and ``y = 12345`` return False through that
same call for exactly the same reason.

This is the second time this defect class has been found in the coverage for
this one invariant: ``tests/c/test_ed25519_canonical_s.c`` had it (``y = p``
is not the signer's key, so verify rejects it either way) and
the former backend-differential tool had it (its corpus contained no
non-canonical ``y`` at all). The lesson is the same each time and it is worth
stating plainly: **a rejection is only evidence when something that differs
from it in exactly one respect is accepted.** A test whose expected result is
"False" needs a paired case whose expected result is "True" and which differs
only in the property under test.

What replaced it
----------------
The pair the C test settled on, driven here through the Python binding:

* ``y = 0`` is a genuine curve point — the curve equation gives ``x² = -1``,
  and ``-1`` is a square mod ``p`` — so it must decode.
* ``y = p`` reduces to ``0``. It denotes *the same point*, non-canonically
  encoded, so it must be refused.

Nothing but the canonicality rule can separate those two, which is what makes
the assertion non-vacuous. They are put to the two decode entry points
(``ama_ed25519_point_add`` and ``ama_ed25519_scalarmult_public``) rather than
to verify, because verify cannot distinguish a decode refusal from a signature
mismatch — that indistinguishability is what made the first version vacuous.

The remaining eighteen band values have no in-range twin (a key whose ``y``
has one needs ``y < 19``, probability ~``19 / 2^255``), so they are asserted
as refusals *alongside* the ``y = 0`` control that proves refusal is not the
uniform answer.

``tests/c/test_ed25519_canonical_s.c`` isolates the predicate itself, and the
frozen oracle (``tests/test_ed25519_frozen_oracle.py``) holds the in-house
backend to the answers the removed vendored one gave on every case.
