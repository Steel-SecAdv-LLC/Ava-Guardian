"""AMA_HAVE_SVE2_IMPL must be defined only where the +sve2 flag is applied.

Audit H5.  ``CMakeLists.txt`` applied ``-march=armv9-a+sve2`` to the SVE2
translation units inside ``if(NOT MSVC)``, but set
``add_compile_definitions(AMA_HAVE_SVE2_IMPL)`` OUTSIDE that guard, so it fired
for any ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`` matching ARM64 — MSVC included.  Every SVE2
TU guards its whole body on ``__ARM_FEATURE_SVE2``, which only that skipped flag
defines, so on MSVC ARM64 the SVE2 objects held zero defined symbols while
``src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c`` still referenced ten SVE2 kernel symbols under
``AMA_HAVE_SVE2_IMPL``: LNK2019 unresolved externals — the exact break the NEON
block was rewritten to prevent.

Reproduced with the equivalent GCC condition (aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc, no +sve2):
``ama_kyber_sve2.o`` / ``ama_sha3_sve2.o`` / ``ama_dilithium_sve2.o`` each
compile to an object with zero defined global symbols; with ``+sve2`` they
define 6 / 1 / 3.  MSVC ARM64 is built by no CI lane, so this structural test is
the coverage: the macro must sit inside the NOT-MSVC block, and the dispatcher's
SVE2 references must all sit under it.
