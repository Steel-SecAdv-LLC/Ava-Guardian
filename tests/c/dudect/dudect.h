 *   https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1123.pdf
 *
 * This is a self-contained implementation of the dudect methodology
 * for empirical constant-time verification using Welch's t-test.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   #define DUDECT_IMPLEMENTATION
 *   #include "dudect.h"
 *
 * The caller must provide:
 *   - A function to prepare input classes
 *   - A function to perform the computation under test
 *   - Call dudect_main() to run the analysis

 * This is not 4.5 and must not be.  4.5 is the two-sided critical value of a
 * single Welch t; the statistic this header computes is the maximum over 21
 * percentile rungs (see dudect_percentile.h), whose null distribution is
 * measurably wider.  The calibration, and the reason a single number now
 * lives in one place instead of three, are in that header. */

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statistics
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This used to be a streaming mean/variance pair feeding one Welch t over
 * every raw sample.  That statistic is dominated by the timing distribution's
 * heavy right tail — preemption, migration, frequency changes — which has
 * nothing to do with the secret and which inflates the pooled variance until
 * a systematic shift in the BULK disappears underneath it.
 *
 * Measured on this tree against a textbook early-exit ``memcmp`` — the most
 * blatant timing leak there is — at 50,000 iterations, 12 repetitions per
 * condition, on idle and contended cores:
 *
 *     raw Welch t (what was here)    detected the leak 19 / 48
 *     percentile-cropped             detected the leak 48 / 48
 *
 * with neither firing on constant-time code.  A gate that misses an obvious
 * leak in 60% of runs is close to no gate at all.
 *
 * The cropped statistic arrived in dudect_percentile.h with the two
 * tools/constant_time harnesses converted to it and this one left behind, so
 * every lane driven from this header — the ML-KEM, ML-DSA, secp256k1,
 * X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id and SIMD-sweep lanes, which is most of
 * the constant-time evidence this repository publishes — kept running the
 * statistic that misses leaks.  It runs the same statistic as the other two
 * harnesses now.
 *
 * With one qualification a lane cannot state for itself: cropping needs at
 * least DUDECT_CROP_MIN_PER_CLASS (128) samples in BOTH classes AFTER the
 * crop, so a lane whose budget is near that floor gets no usable rung and its
 * reported statistic is the uncropped Welch t.  The SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f sign
 * lane caps at 256 measurements — about 128 per class before any cropping —
 * and is exactly that case.  dudect_print_result() now says "UNCROPPED" for
 * such a lane instead of printing the same line as every other one.
 *
 * The cost is memory: cropping needs the samples, not a running summary, so a
 * context now allocates and must be freed.  ``dudect_ctx_init`` takes the
 * measurement budget and REPORTS FAILURE, which callers must check — a lane
 * that could not allocate must not go on to report a clean t of 0.0.

 * second, uncalibrated verdict path sitting beside the real one in the same

 * size, via dudect_lane_finish() in the harness — and dudect_rounds.h is the
 * single authority on what a measurement means.
 *
 * The effect size behind the statistic, in nanoseconds: the LARGER in
 * magnitude of the uncropped and the winning rung's per-class mean difference.
 * Only meaningful after dudect_get_t().
 *
 * Not the winning rung's alone, which is what this returned.  The verdict rule
 * gates on this number — |delta| < DUDECT_MIN_EFFECT_NS is SUB_FLOOR, which
 * does not fail the build — so a leak whose effect lives in the tail cropping
 * removes could clear the floor uncropped and be adjudicated on a cropped

 * this function cannot see: whether the lane is registered info-only (ML-DSA
 * signing is rejection-sampled and secp256k1's RFC 6979 nonce derivation
 * retries, so both are expected to vary and are classified INFO by the
 * summary), and whether it exceeded the threshold in every round or just one.
 *
 * The result was that a completely healthy run printed two lines reading
 * "FAIL - potential leakage" every single time, in a tool whose entire job is
 * to make one real leakage report legible.  Alarms that always fire are alarms
 * nobody reads.  The summary is the authority on PASS/INFO/FAIL; this line
 * states what was measured.
