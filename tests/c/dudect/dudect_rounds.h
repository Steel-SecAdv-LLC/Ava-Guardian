 * @brief Multi-round verdict rule shared by every dudect harness in the tree.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT IS ONE FILE
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Three harnesses ran the same multi-round loop and each got the same thing
 * wrong: `tests/c/test_dudect.c`, `tools/constant_time/dudect_crypto.c` and
 * `tools/constant_time/dudect_harness.c`.  All three printed "Retrying to rule
 * out noise" (or "environmental noise"), and none of them ruled out anything.
 *
 * The loop passed when *any single round* had no failing lane and failed
 * otherwise — without ever checking whether the **same** lane failed twice.
 * With ~24 lanes and ordinary scheduling jitter on a shared runner, a
 * different lane tripping in each of three rounds is a routine outcome, and
 * the harness then reported "Potential timing leakage detected across 3
 * rounds": a claim of consistency it had never tested.  A false alarm from
 * these gates is indistinguishable in the log from a real finding, which is
 * the property that makes a real finding get waved through.
 *
 * The rule here is the one those messages already promised, at the tighter of
 * the two readings: **a lane must exceed the threshold in a majority of rounds
 * to count as a failure.**  A leak reproduces — its t-statistic grows with
 * measurements and the same lane trips most or all of the time.  Noise moves.
 * The per-lane threshold is untouched, so this removes false alarms rather
 * than sensitivity.
 *
 * Two of the three harnesses also discarded their per-lane t-values between
 * rounds (`run_round` returned a bool), so the summary could not show whether
 * a finding reproduced — the single most useful fact about a timing result.
 * Evidence is accumulated here instead, and printed as a `failed/run` ratio
 * beside each lane.
 *
 * It lives in one header because three copies of a security-gate decision rule
 * is how the copies drift apart, and because the self-test below then covers
 * all three at once.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHY MAJORITY AND NOT ALL
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * "Every round" and "most rounds" both rule out the one-off, and the choice
 * between them only matters for a lane sitting right at the threshold.  Under
 * an all-rounds rule such a lane — tripping two rounds in three — is reported
 * as noise and the run goes green.  That is the wrong way to be wrong: a
 * primitive drifting toward a real leak is exactly the finding this gate exists
 * to surface, and one within-threshold round is a thin reason to discard two
 * over-threshold ones.  A majority keeps the property that made the change
 * worth making (a single trip never fails the build) while refusing to sit on
 * repeated evidence.
 *
 * The summary still prints the ratio beside every lane, so a 1/3 is visible as
 * a `NOISE` row rather than vanishing.  Nothing is hidden; the difference is
 * only where the build stops.
 *
 * This interacts with the early exit, and the interaction is easy to get
 * wrong.  Under an all-rounds rule, stopping at the first clean round is
 * always safe.  Under a majority it is not: a lane that tripped round 1 and is
 * clean in round 2 sits at 1/2, but had round 3 run and tripped it would be
 * 2/3 — a failure the early exit would have skipped.  So the loop stops early
 * only while *nothing* has tripped at all (`dudect_rounds_any_failure`), which
 * keeps the one-round fast path for a healthy run and forces the full schedule
 * precisely when the extra evidence is what decides the verdict.
 *
 * A lane flagged `fatal` — a setup failure or a per-class return-code mismatch
 * — is exempt from the majority rule and from info-only suppression.  It is
 * not a timing measurement, so retrying it proves nothing and one occurrence
 * is conclusive: the lane never witnessed its invariant.

/* ============================================================================
 * THE EFFECT-SIZE FLOOR, AND WHY A t-VALUE ALONE CANNOT DECIDE
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * t = (m0 - m1) / se, and se falls as 1/sqrt(n).  So for ANY difference that
 * is not exactly zero, |t| grows without bound as measurements accumulate:
 * significance is a statement about how well a difference was RESOLVED, not
 * about how large it is.  A gate that reads only |t| therefore decides on
 * measurement precision, and at high measurement counts it decides on
 * differences far below anything a timing attack could use — or a CPU could
 * even produce from the source under test.
 *
 * That is not a theoretical worry here; it is what this harness did.  On one
 * CI run at 100,000 measurements, with the percentile-cropped statistic:
 *
 *     lane                                    |t|        difference
 *     --------------------------------------  ---------  ----------
 *     AES-GCM tag verify                        6.27       +0.199 ns   FAILED
 *     Ascon-AEAD128 encrypt                    21.88       +0.596 ns   FAILED
 *     agent binding check                      41.72       -1.141 ns   FAILED
 *     secp256k1 scalar multiplication           1.44      -35.200 ns   passed
 *     X25519 scalarmult batch x4                2.03      -78.135 ns   passed
 *     SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f sign                    2.14   +53932.078 ns   passed
 *
 * The lanes that failed are the ones measured most precisely, not the ones
 * with the largest difference — by five orders of magnitude in the other
 * direction.  Every failing difference is between a fraction of one CPU cycle
 * and about two cycles.
 *
 * And they are not properties of the code.  In the SAME workflow run, on a
 * second runner, the same binary read `Ascon-AEAD128 encrypt` at -2.87 (clean)
 * and `agent binding check` with its excursions pointing the other way.  A
 * difference that reverses between two machines running identical instructions
 * is a property of the machines.  This repository has already identified what
 * it is and recorded it in `.github/workflows/dudect.yml`: data-operand-
 * dependent execution — what Intel's DOITM and ARM's PSTATE.DIT exist to
 * control — measured there against retired-instruction counts that are
 * IDENTICAL across all eight input classes, cross-class delta 0, noise floor
 * 0.
 *
 * That is one candidate, and it is the one this repository named first.  The
 * candidate it has since MEASURED is closer to home: a class-correlated
 * branch or address in the harness itself, between the class draw and the
 * opening timer.  Run as a null experiment — byte-identical input in both
 * classes, so the true effect is exactly zero — the ternary class select the
 * lanes used to carry reads over threshold in 4 of 8 runs on the AES-GCM
 * decrypt lane and 3 of 5 on the Kyber decapsulation lane, every excursion
 * one sign, while the masked-merge staging that replaced it reads 0 of 8 and
 * 0 of 5.  Both explanations produce a difference that is fixed for a binary
 * on a host and reverses between hosts; the difference is that this one is
 * the harness's to remove, and it has been.  Anything a lane reports now is
 * measured with `dudect_stage_select` in front of it and
 * `tools/check_dudect_class_staging.py` enforcing that nothing else gets in.
 *
 * So the floor below is not a tolerance for leaks.  It is the resolution
 * limit of a wall-clock apparatus on shared hardware, stated instead of
 * ignored, and everything under it is delegated to the tool that can actually
 * decide it: the deterministic instruction-count gates
 * (`tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py --target ghash|consttime|ascon-hash`),
 * which measure retired instructions with a zero-instruction noise floor and
 * cannot flake.
 *
 * WHAT THE FLOOR MUST NOT DO is hide a leak, so it is set from measurement in
 * both directions:
 *
 *   above every artefact observed          largest was 1.141 ns
 *   below every real leak mechanism        a mispredicted branch is 7-10 ns,
 *                                          an L1 miss 30-50 ns, one extra AES
 *                                          round ~4 ns, and the early-exit
 *                                          memcmp this statistic was
 *                                          calibrated against moves the mean
 *                                          by hundreds of ns
 *
 * 2 ns clears the largest observed artefact by 1.8x and sits at least 3.5x
 * below the cheapest real mechanism.  Measured directly against the canary
 * this statistic was calibrated on — a textbook early-exit ``memcmp`` over 64
 * bytes, first-byte versus last-byte mismatch, 10 repetitions of 50,000
 * measurements on a quiet host:
 *
 *     leaky memcmp        |t| = 412..481, over threshold 10/10,  |diff| = 22.4 ns
 *     ama_consttime_memcmp |t| = 0.9..3.2, over threshold  0/10,  |diff| =  1.8 ns
 *
 * The leak clears the floor by 11x and would clear it at a tenth of the
 * measurements.  The constant-time function's own difference lands at 1.8 ns
 * on a QUIET machine, which is the apparatus's noise floor measured a second
 * way and independently puts the floor at the right order of magnitude.  For scale, this repository already
 * applies exactly this discipline to its Python POST timing oracle, where
 * `ama_cryptography/_self_test.py` sets `_TIMING_MIN_EFFECT_NS` to
 * `max(50, 4 x clock_resolution)` — 50 ns on Linux — for the same reason and
 * citing the same runner behaviour.  This floor is 25x stricter than that.
 *
 * A lane under the floor is NOT reported as a pass.  It gets its own verdict
 * (DUDECT_LANE_SUB_FLOOR), prints its difference, and says which gate owns
 * the claim it could not make.  Nothing is silent. */
