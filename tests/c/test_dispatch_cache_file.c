 * @file test_dispatch_cache_file.c
 * @brief AMA_DISPATCH_CACHE_FILE roundtrip + safety contract test
 *
 * Pins the v3.2.0 dispatch-cache surface so future changes can't
 * regress its three load-bearing properties:
 *
 *   1. Cache file is created with mode 0600 (user-only) — closes the
 *      default-umask 0666 risk that `fopen("we")` left open
 *      (CodeQL #534).  Mode is checked via stat().
 *
 *   2. The fingerprint string follows the documented schema
 *      (`v1|<arch>|sha3=N|...|avx2=N|...`) — guards against
 *      doc/implementation drift (Copilot review #325 alerts #9 / #12 /
 *      #13).  Schema match is checked by string-presence assertions on
 *      the key names that appear in `include/ama_dispatch.h` and
 *      `CHANGELOG.md` v3.2.0 release-line.
 *
 *   3. The verbose-mode "cache HIT" log reports the cached timing
 *      values rather than zeros — alert #10 was that the cache-hit
 *      verdict log displayed `simd=0 ns vs generic=0 ns` because the
 *      load path ignored timing fields.  Post-fix, the timings round-
 *      trip through the file.  Checked by re-reading the cache file
 *      after a write and asserting the timing keys carry non-empty
 *      integer values.
 *
 * The test is build-config-aware: it must run with
 * `AMA_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOTUNE` unset (so the bench actually runs and
 * writes the cache) and on a non-MSVC build (the cache code path is
 * `#else`-stubbed under MSVC — the cache is a no-op there and the
 * assertions below would all fail spuriously).

     * Architecturally we cannot exercise the rejection contract via
     * fork+ama_dispatch_init in the same test process: Linux
     * fork() inherits the parent's `pthread_once` state, so the

     * r3275565655 surfaced that the hardcoded `/tmp/etc/ama_evil`
     * probe never appeared in any run, not because the sanitizer
     * rejected the path, but because the cache code path never
     * fired in the child at all.

     * The clean alternative is the direct unit test below: the
     * sanitizer is a pure-input pure-output predicate, so calling
     * the test-mode-exported `dispatch_cache_path_sanitize_for_tests`
     * with every "must reject" class and every "must accept"
     * class IS the contract.  No fork, no filesystem side-effect
     * dependency, no race with pthread_once.
     *
     * Pointer-identity is intentionally not part of the contract: the
     * production path splits into a canonicalized parent-directory fd
     * plus a validated basename.  The test shim reconstructs the same
     * canonical display form for accept-class assertions.  The tests
     * below assert non-NULL on accept and stable canonicalization for
