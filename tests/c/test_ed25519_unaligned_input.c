 * @file test_ed25519_unaligned_input.c
 * @brief Ed25519 accepts caller buffers at any alignment, because it promises to
 *
 * `include/ama_cryptography.h` states exactly one requirement of
 * `ama_ed25519_verify`'s `signature` and `public_key`: "exactly 64 readable
 * bytes" and "exactly 32 readable bytes".  It says nothing about alignment,
 * and `const uint8_t *` imposes none, so `verify(sig, msg, len, packet + 3)`
 * is a legal call and must work.
 *
 * It did not.  The vendored backend that was then the x86-64 default (removed
 * in the twenty-first maintenance pass) read the public key with
 * `*(uint64_t *)(in + 0)` in its decoder — a load that requires 8-byte
 * alignment from a pointer that has none.  That is undefined behaviour under
 * C11 6.3.2.3p7, and UBSan reported it as a "load of misaligned address ...
 * for type 'uint64_t', which requires 8 byte alignment" inside
 * ama_ed25519_verify.  The in-house decoder assembles limbs byte by byte.
 *
 * The `AddressSanitizer + UBSan` job runs `halt_on_error=1`, so for a caller
 * with an unaligned buffer this was not a warning — a signature check became
 * an abort.  The whole suite passed anyway, because every existing test hands
 * the library a `uint8_t[32]` local or static, which every compiler in use
 * aligns to at least 8.  Nothing exercised the contract as written.
 *
 * This test does.  It walks every offset in a byte slab, so at least one call
 * per loop is misaligned for 2, 4 and 8 bytes at once, and it asserts the
 * *verdict* as well — a good signature must still verify and a corrupted one
 * must still fail — so it is a real behavioural check in an ordinary build
 * and the UB tripwire in the sanitizer lanes.
