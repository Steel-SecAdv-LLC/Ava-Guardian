 * @file test_ed25519_canonical_r.c
 * @brief RFC 8032 §5.1.7 step 1 / §5.1.3 canonical-R enforcement — INVARIANT-38
 *
 * §5.1.7 step 1 says to DECODE the signature's first half as a point, and
 * §5.1.3 is what decoding means: a y >= p fails, and x = 0 with the sign bit
 * set fails.  Both single-signature verifiers already rejected every such R,
 * but only as a side effect: they re-encode [S]B - [h]A and compare bytes,
 * and the encoders emit canonical encodings only, so a non-canonical R could
 * never match.  The BATCH routine of the vendored backend the tree then
 * carried had no such comparison — it decoded R and checked the aggregate
 * group equation — so nothing rejected a non-canonical R there.
 *
 * The discriminating case is R = the identity's sign-bit-set encoding
 * (`01 00..00 | 0x80`).  unpack decodes it to the identity and drops the set
 * sign bit, because x = 0 has a single root and the conditional negate is a
 * no-op.  Setting S = h * a mod L makes [S]B - [h]A the identity, so the
 * batch equation holds.  Producing it needs the signer's own key and no
 * forgery, which is the point: the SIGNER can mint a signature that batch
 * verifiers accept and single verifiers reject.
 *
 * The count used to matter.  That batch routine ran its multi-scalar path
 * only `while (num > 3)` and verified per entry otherwise, so counts 1..3
 * rejected before the fix and counts >= 4 accepted — which is why every
 * batch assertion below states its count.  B1 (commit 0cd6bb3, 5.0.0
 * pre-tag audit) then removed the aggregate path entirely: batch verify is
 * an unconditional per-entry loop over ama_ed25519_verify.  There is no
 * count boundary left, and single verify rejects a non-canonical R whether
 * or not the predicate exists (the vendored backend itself left the tree in
 * the twenty-first maintenance pass).
 *
 * Each assertion is therefore marked SMOKE (behavioral: the batch path
 * rejects these signatures, on every backend, but a neutered
 * ama_ed25519_signature_r_is_canonical does NOT make it fail), RANGE (a
 * direct unit test of the predicate itself — the assertions that DO fail
 * under that mutation), or PIN-COUNT (pins the count-overflow argument
 * guard, which the mutation does not touch).
 *
 * Measured, post-B1, with the predicate neutered to `return 1` on the
 * then-default vendored build: 45 passed / 4 failed — the four RANGE checks
 * alone, with every batch line printing [ OK ].  That is the same result
 * the in-tree build has always given, and it is WHY the batch lines are
 * SMOKE: the file's earlier claim that they discriminate on that backend at
 * count >= 4 (measured pre-B1 as 30 passed / 19 failed) described the
 * aggregate path B1 deleted.  The predicate stays load-bearing at the
 * verify entry (an explicit §5.1.3 decision, cheaper and earlier than the
 * re-encode fallback) and the RANGE block is its pin.

 * can never match with or without the predicate.  Measured on THIS tree with
 * ama_ed25519_signature_r_is_canonical neutered to `return 1`: the
 * then-default vendored build reported 45 passed / 4 failed, and all four
 * failures were the [1] RANGE unit tests of the predicate itself — every
 * batch line prints [ OK ].  The pre-B1 aggregate path, where these lines
 * genuinely discriminated at count >= 4 (30 passed / 19 failed under the
 * same mutation), was deleted by commit 0cd6bb3; a PIN label kept from that
 * architecture would be a claim the test can no longer cash.  The count
