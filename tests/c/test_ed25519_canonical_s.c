 * @file test_ed25519_canonical_s.c
 * @brief RFC 8032 §5.1.7 canonical-S enforcement — INVARIANT-26
 *
 * Only S = s + kL can test the range check. Those cases satisfy the group
 * equation (the scalar multiply reduces mod L), so nothing but the §5.1.7
 * range check rejects them. Every other malformed-S case fails the group
 * equation instead and passes with or without the fix — which is why
 * test_ed25519_verify_equiv.c case D.3 was never coverage for this defect.
 *
 * Each assertion below is marked PIN (fails against a build with the check
 * removed at the site it names), SMOKE (does not), or RANGE (a direct unit
 * test of the §5.1.7 predicate `ama_ed25519_scalar_is_canonical`, pinning
 * the L-1 / L / L+1 boundary — including the accept side, S = L-1, that the
 * integration PINs cannot reach).
 *
 * This paragraph used to claim "with the check neutered at the three verify
 * sites, every PIN fails and no SMOKE does, on both backends".  That was
 * measured and it is false, in two places, so the labels now name their
 * backend and their site:
 *
 *   - The S = s + 2L pair is a pin on the in-tree backend only.  Neutering
 *     ama_ed25519_signature_s_is_canonical in the since-removed vendored
 *     backend failed the three S = s + L checks and left the two S = s + 2L
 *     checks green, because its legacy `RS[63] & 224` test caught bit 253.
 *     Their labels have always said "fe51 path"; only the header's blanket
 *     sentence was wrong.
 *
 *   - The canonical-y checks on the VERIFY path were vacuous outright.
 *     Handing verify the encoding y = p together with a signature made under
 *     a different key rejects for the wrong-key reason with or without
 *     §5.1.3, so short-circuiting the y guard at the vendored backend's two
 *     verify sites — and nowhere else — left this file at "All 41 checks passed" and
 *     the whole ctest suite green.  Two encodings and a forged signature fix
 *     that, below: y = p + 1 and the identity's sign-bit-set encoding both
 *     decode (once the rule is gone) to the IDENTITY, and a signature
 *     (R = [S]B, S) verifies against the identity for every message, so a
 *     build without the rule accepts a universal forgery and this file goes
 *     red.  The old y = p assertions are kept and relabelled SMOKE, which is
 *     what they always were.
 *
 * Covers single verify and batch verify.  As of B1 (5.0.0 pre-tag audit) both
 * backends' batch verify is a per-entry loop over ama_ed25519_verify, so the
 * canonical-S rule reaches the batch path through single verify rather than a
 * separate batch site — a batch entry is rejected for exactly the reason the
 * same bytes are rejected by single verify.
