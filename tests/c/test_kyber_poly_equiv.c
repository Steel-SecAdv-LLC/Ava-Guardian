 * @file test_kyber_poly_equiv.c
 * @brief Cross-implementation equivalence test for the ML-KEM-1024
 *        `kyber_poly_add` / `kyber_poly_sub` / `kyber_poly_reduce`
 *        dispatch slots against the inlined scalar reference in
 *        `src/c/ama_kyber.c`.
 *
 *        ALL THREE slots use **strict byte-identity** comparison.
 *
 *        `poly_reduce` used to be compared with a mod-q-tolerant
 *        comparator, justified by the SVE2 kernel using a *centered*
 *        Barrett (a `+ (1 << 25)` rounding term) that could pick a
 *        representative differing by exactly q.  That kernel no longer
 *        exists: `src/c/sve2/ama_kyber_sve2.c::barrett_reduce_scalar`
 *        is the truncating form, character-for-character the same
 *        computation as `barrett_reduce` in `src/c/ama_kyber.c` and as
 *        `barrett_reduce_neon`, and its own comment records the change.
 *        A tolerance kept for a convention nothing implements is an
 *        assertion weakened for no reason: it would accept a real
 *        off-by-q from a future kernel as readily as the one it was
 *        written for.  The range check that comparator also carried —
 *        outputs must stay inside [-2q, 2q] — is kept, as
 *        `check_reduce_range()`.
 *
 * Mirrors the multi-lane structure of `test_kyber_ntt_equiv.c`:
 *
 *   1. **Dispatched-pointer path** — exercises whichever helpers the
 *      runtime dispatcher installed (today: SVE2 on ARMv9, NULL on
 *      every other tier — modern GCC/Clang already auto-vectorise the
 *      trivial int16 add/sub loop and there is no production NEON /
 *      AVX2 helper).  When the dispatched slot is NULL on this build
 *      the lane logs INFO and skips, mirroring the kyber_ntt convention.
 *   2. **Direct per-ISA SIMD-symbol path** — for every `AMA_HAVE_*_IMPL`
 *      macro defined at build time, references the SVE2 kernel symbols
 *      directly (bypassing the dispatcher's auto-tune, which on noisy
 *      hosts can demote SVE2 back to generic).  Each direct lane is
 *      runtime-ISA-gated via `ama_has_arm_sve2()` so kernels compiled
 *      into the build do not SIGILL on CPUs that lack the ISA.
 *
 * SKIP semantics: the test exits with code 77 only if NONE of the
 * direct lanes was exercised AND the dispatched lane found no SIMD
 * helper installed (truly scalar build on a scalar runtime).
 *
 * If this test fails, the dispatched Kyber poly helpers diverge from
 * the scalar baseline used inside `poly_add` / `poly_sub` /
 * `poly_reduce` — every ML-KEM-1024 encapsulation / decapsulation
 * would silently miscompute and break interop with every standards-
 * conformant peer.  The trailing `poly_reduce` after `poly_add` in
 * production code is load-bearing (see the comment in `src/c/ama_kyber.c`),
 * so a divergence in any of the three helpers is observable end-to-end.

 * measured here by check_reduce_image_exhaustive() below, which
 * enumerates all 65,536 int16 inputs; not asserted.
 * Not [-q+1, q-1]: q itself is attainable, for the nine inputs that are
 * exact negative multiples of q from -3329 down to -29961 (a == -q
 * yields t == -2 via the arithmetic right shift, so the return value is
 * a - t*q == +q).  Never negative: the truncating shift floors toward
 * -infinity and always undershoots the quotient.  `check_reduce_range()`
 * below bounds the representative at exactly that, [0, q].
 *
 * It used to say "±q" and bound at [-2q, 2q].  The -q half has no
 * witness, and the 4x-loose positive bound is the difference between a
 * range check that can reject an off-by-q or sign-flipped kernel and one
 * that cannot.
 *
 * Every wired kernel computes this SAME truncating formula — the
 * production scalar `barrett_reduce`, `barrett_reduce_neon` (vqdmulhq
 * >>15 then >>11, also unrounded) and the SVE2
 * `barrett_reduce_scalar` — so byte-identity is the right comparison
 * for `poly_reduce` as much as for the non-reducing add/sub.  A kernel
 * that adopts a different Barrett convention would be a deliberate
 * change to what the dispatch table may substitute for what, and it
 * should land with the comparison it needs rather than find a
