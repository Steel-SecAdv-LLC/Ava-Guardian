 * @file test_aes_gcm_backend_introspect.c
 * @brief Audit-trail test for ama_aes_gcm_active_backend() and the
 *        NIST SP 800-38D length-limit enforcement (audit Issues 5+6).
 *
 * Acceptance criteria:
 *   1. ama_aes_gcm_active_backend() returns a non-NULL, recognized
 *      label after dispatch initialization.
 *   2. The label is NEVER "table-insecure" unless the build was
 *      explicitly opted in via -DAMA_AES_TABLE_INSECURE=ON.  This
 *      asserts INVARIANT-20 (constant-time AES default) at runtime.
 *   3. ama_aes256_gcm_encrypt and ama_aes256_gcm_decrypt reject
 *      pt_len > 2^36 - 32 (NIST SP 800-38D §5.2.1.1) with
 *      AMA_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM.  We do not allocate a 64 GB buffer to
 *      test this — pt_len is checked BEFORE the dispatcher reads
 *      plaintext, so a NULL/short plaintext pointer with an oversized
 *      length is sufficient to exercise the guard.
 *   4. AAD length is similarly bounded at 2^61 - 1 bytes.
 *
 * The test returns CTest's reserved skip code 77 when running on a
 * host where size_t cannot represent 2^36 (32-bit hosts) — the C
 * limit check in ama_aes_gcm.c is still enforced at runtime; the
 * length-limit assertion below can only EXERCISE the guard where
 * the platform permits the comparison.  tests/c/CMakeLists.txt
 * propagates the skip code via `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 77` so CTest
 * surfaces the lane as "Skipped" instead of a silent pass on those
 * hosts (Copilot review #322).
