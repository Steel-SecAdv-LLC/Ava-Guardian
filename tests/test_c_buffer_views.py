"""
Pins for :class:`pqc_backends._CBufferViews` — the batched buffer borrow.

The generator-based ``@contextlib.contextmanager`` form of ``_c_buffer_view``
cost ~1 us per buffer per call in generator machinery alone; four of them on
every one-shot AEAD call halved the Python-level AES-256-GCM throughput
(measured 8.4 us vs 3.4 us per 1 KiB call — the difference between the ~283k
ops/sec the May 2026 ARM floors were calibrated against and the ~132k the
wrappers have delivered since).  The hand-written class handles all of a
call's buffers in one enter/exit with a pass-through fast path for ``bytes``.

What must never regress, pinned here from both directions:

* the SECURITY contract — ``bytearray``/writable-``memoryview`` key material
  is borrowed in place through the buffer protocol, never copied to an
  immutable ``bytes`` outside the secure-wipe path;
* the release contract — every acquired ``memoryview`` is released on exit,
  including when acquisition fails partway through;
* the validation contract — multi-dimensional and non-byte buffers are
  rejected, read-only memoryviews degrade to a copied ``bytes`` (public
  inputs only), and results arrive in input order.
