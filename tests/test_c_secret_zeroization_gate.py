"""The INVARIANT-6 C-zeroization gate must fail on the pattern it names.

``tools/check_c_secret_zeroization.py`` exists because the semgrep rule that
claimed this coverage could not run (scoped to ``src/c/**``; every scan targets
``ama_cryptography/`` only).  A replacement gate is worth nothing unless it can
actually fail, so this exercises BOTH directions — detection and non-detection —
on purpose-built input, plus the real tree.

        The runs are interleaved by ROUND — each round scans every size
        once — rather than exhausting one size's repeats back to back.
        Back-to-back repeats of one size all complete inside ~2 ms, so a
        contention burst longer than that cluster inflates every sample the
        minimum is drawn from while leaving the neighbouring size's floor
        clean, and the ratio breaks even though every individual sample
        obeyed the one-sided model: measured on a 4-core host under full
        synthetic saturation, the clustered form failed 2 of 6 runs.  A
        burst that spans one interleaved round slows every size in that
        round together — ratio-neutral — and each size's floor is then the
        minimum over seven temporally separated rounds.  The same
        saturation experiment on this form: 0 failures.

        The ceiling is 2.8x rather than 2.0x because even floor timings
        carry residual noise; quadratic growth is 4x and cubic 8x, so the
        gap is wide enough to discriminate.  Measured here at the time of
        writing: 1.71-2.07x across all three shapes.

        Interleaving was still not enough.  The macOS 3.14 lane read 2.94x
        for the failing-value shape on a commit that changed neither the
        pattern nor this gate, and the same measurement had been green on
        that runner one commit earlier -- so the code under test was
        bit-identical across the two outcomes.  Reproduced here: 1 failure
        in 8 runs under full synthetic saturation.  Interleaving equalises
        WHEN each size is sampled but not how LONG each sample is exposed,
        and the largest payload's scan is the longest, so a contention
        burst is likeliest to land on it -- a bias that is one-sided in
        exactly the direction that breaks the ratio.

        So the whole measurement is repeated, up to
        :data:`_LINEARITY_ATTEMPTS` times, and the test passes as soon as
        one comes back under the ceiling.  This sharpens the check rather
        than loosening it, and the one-sided noise model is why: noise can
        only ever inflate a sample, the floor over a round already discards
        all but the least-disturbed one, and a further measurement can only
        move each size's floor DOWN, towards its true cost.  Both floors
        therefore converge on truth as attempts accumulate, and the ratio
        converges on the pattern's real growth -- ~2x for a linear pattern
        and ~4x for a quadratic one.  A quadratic pattern cannot be
        retried under the ceiling: reaching 2.8x from 4x would need the
        SMALLER size's floor to be overestimated by 30% in every one of
        the attempts, which is the one thing the model forbids.  Measured
        under the same saturation that failed the single-shot form: 0
        failures in 10 runs, against 1 in 8 before.

        The other direction was checked by planting nested quantifiers in
        the value group -- ``0+`` as ``0*0*``, and the bounded
        ``(?:0{1,40})+`` -- and neither produced a ratio any number of
        retries could rescue, because neither COMPLETES: both ran past a
        300-second timeout at the sizes this test uses, and past it again
        at 2^8-2^10.  That is the honest shape of the discrimination here.
        A pattern that has lost linearity does not land just over the
        ceiling where a retry might reach it; it hangs, and what catches
        it is the absolute-time bound at the top of this class, which is
        1 second for 200,000 characters.  This ratio test guards the
        narrower case of growth that is superlinear but still fast, and
        for that case the retry costs nothing and removes the false
        positives.
