"""Tests for ``tools/check_dudect_class_staging.py``.

The gate exists because a dudect lane whose class reaches the timer through a
branch or an address selection confounds the class with the harness's own
machine state, and that bias is fixed for a given binary on a given host — so
it reproduces every round with the same sign and is indistinguishable from a
leak by any threshold or round count.

Measured on this tree with byte-identical input in both classes (true effect
exactly zero), 500,000 measurements per run, 8 runs, threshold 5.0: the
ternary-select form the first version of this gate sanctioned trips in 4 of 8
runs; the masked-merge form ``dudect_stage_select`` trips in 0 of 8.  Placing
one class's key across two cache lines drives the same statistic to
|t| = 13.5..30.9 in 10 of 10 runs.

A gate is only worth its runtime if it fails on the thing it claims to catch,
so every case below is a mutation: the gate must reject a ternary on the class
before the timer (in both spellings the tree has used), an ``if`` on the class,
a ``[class_idx]`` address selection, an unaligned staging buffer, a class draw
with no timer after it, and a missing input file — and must accept the
masked-merge staging, the reused-probe form, and branchless class arithmetic.
