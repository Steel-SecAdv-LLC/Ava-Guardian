"""The pre-commit fixers must not rewrite bytes that have to stay verbatim.

``trailing-whitespace`` and ``end-of-file-fixer`` do not report — they
REWRITE.  Unscoped, ``pre-commit run --all-files`` on the tree as it stood
when this scope was set modified 150 files: 94 binary seeds under
``fuzz/seed_corpus/``, the vendored Ed25519 headers the tree then carried,
19 NIST/Ascon KAT vector files, the FIPS 140-3 power-on self-test KAT JSON,
and generated charts and benchmark JSON.

Nothing in CI catches that.  Measured on the rewritten tree, the corpus
generators' ``--check``, ``check_corpus_originality.py``,
``check_vendor_isolation.py`` and all 135 KAT tests still passed.  A
corruption that every gate calls clean is the kind worth a test of its own.

The last test here is the one that matters: it proves the exclusions are
load-bearing by showing the protected files really do contain bytes those
hooks would change.  An exclude list that guards nothing would pass a
regex-shaped test and still be worthless.
