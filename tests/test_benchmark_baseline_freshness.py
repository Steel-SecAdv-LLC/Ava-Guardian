Benchmark baselines must not silently outlive their own validity window
=======================================================================

Both `benchmarks/baseline.json` and `benchmarks/arm-baseline.json` declare
`metadata.applies_through_release` — the last release the floors in that file
were calibrated for. Nothing read that field: a repo-wide search for it
returned matches only inside the two JSON files and the prose that describes
them, never in a gate, a workflow, or the runner.

That is the failure mode this pins. The floors were measured against v2.1.2
and declared valid through v3.0.0, while the library shipped 3.4.0 — four
minor releases past the window — and the regression job kept reporting PASS.
It could hardly do otherwise: measured throughput had moved so far above the
stale floors that `benchmark-report.md` recorded deltas of -642% and -1806%
and still called them passes. A gate whose thresholds no longer bear any
relation to the code cannot fail, and a gate that cannot fail is worse than no
gate, because it manufactures assurance a reviewer will rely on.

So the window is now enforced rather than merely documented: when the
package's minor version moves past `applies_through_release`, this test fails
and names the remedy — re-measure on a canonical runner and update the floors
with the justification `benchmarks/check_baseline_justification.py` already
requires for any baseline edit.

Patch releases are deliberately tolerated. A z-bump carries no performance
intent, so requiring recalibration for one would be noise; the check compares
`(major, minor)` only.
