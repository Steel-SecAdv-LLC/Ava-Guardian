"""
Tests for the workflow command verifier (``tools/check_workflow_commands.py``).

The checker exists because ``release.yml`` runs only on a tag push, so every
defect in it stays invisible until a release is attempted.  Three real ones
shipped that way — a retired ``macos-13`` runner label, a ``python -c`` payload
broken by YAML folding, and POSIX single-quoting handed to ``cmd.exe`` — and
each on its own was enough to produce a release with no binary artefacts.

A fourth class arrived with immutable releases, which freeze a release's tag
and assets at publish while leaving its title and notes editable: a ``name:``
that reset a hand-edited title, a ``body:`` without ``append_body`` that
destroyed hand-edited notes, and a prerelease that published before its assets
uploaded.  Same failure mode as the first three — invisible until a tag exists.

Both directions are pinned here, because a checker that only ever reports
"clean" is indistinguishable from one that has stopped working:

* **Detection** — each historical defect, reproduced verbatim, is reported with
  an actionable remedy.  For the release-publishing class the pre-fix step is
  replanted whole and must yield all three findings at once.
* **Non-detection** — the shapes this repository legitimately uses (escaped
  quotes inside a double-quoted payload, matrix references, multi-line shell
  scripts, a stable release drafted automatically by the action) do not produce
  false positives, since a checker that cries wolf gets bypassed.

The final test sweeps the repository's own workflows.  If a future edit
reintroduces any of these classes, that test fails on the pull request rather
than on release day.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Round two (audit R2).
#
# The first round lifted the kill rate from 62.7 % to 81.1 %, and reading the
# 89 survivors found a flaw in the round-one tests themselves: parametrising
# over a table (`@pytest.mark.parametrize("label", sorted(SUPPORTED_LABELS))`)
# tests the table against ITSELF.  Delete an entry and the parametrisation
# simply generates one case fewer — every case still passes, and the gate now
# rejects a runner label the repository legitimately uses, or accepts a retired
# one.  That is the same self-referential shape this whole audit exists to
# find, reproduced in the audit's own tests.
#
# So each curated table is pinned to a literal below.  The literal is the
# claim: these labels were verified against GitHub's published runner images on
# 2026-07-25, and a future edit must restate them rather than silently drop
# one.  The per-entry behaviour tests above stay — together they say "this is
# the set, and every member of it behaves".
