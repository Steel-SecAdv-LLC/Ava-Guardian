"""Hardware AES-GCM must not depend on the AVX2 build option.

``CMakeLists.txt``'s AES-NI block has always carried this claim::

    # NOTE: Independent of AMA_ENABLE_SIMD — AES-NI is a distinct ISA extension
    # from AVX2/SSE. Disabling SIMD should not disable hardware AES acceleration.

and it was inverted.  The only x86 AES-NI kernel in the tree,
``src/c/avx2/ama_aes_gcm_avx2.c``, sat in ``AMA_AVX2_SOURCES``, compiled only
inside ``if(AMA_ENABLE_SIMD AND AMA_ENABLE_AVX2)``; the dispatcher installed it
only when ``dispatch_info.aes_gcm >= AMA_IMPL_AVX2``; and the one flag the
block actually set went to ``src/c/ama_aes_gcm.c``, which contains no SIMD
intrinsic at all, so it emitted nothing while a STATUS line announced hardware
AES was enabled.

Measured by building the library three ways and asking
``ama_aes_gcm_active_backend()`` what is installed:

===================  =====================  ====================
configuration        before                 after
===================  =====================  ====================
SIMD on, AVX2 on     ``aes-ni-pclmul``      ``aes-ni-pclmul``
SIMD on, AVX2 off    ``bitsliced-software`` ``aes-ni-pclmul``
SIMD off             ``bitsliced-software`` ``aes-ni-pclmul``
===================  =====================  ====================

That is real work lost on every x86 CPU with AES-NI but without AVX2
(Westmere through Ivy Bridge, and any VM masking the AVX2 bit) and in every
build that turns the option off — silently, because the fallback is correct,
just slower.

``TestTheBackendAcrossBuildConfigurations`` re-runs exactly that measurement:
it configures and builds the static library three ways and links a probe that
calls ``ama_aes_gcm_active_backend()``.  It is marked ``slow`` and skips when
no compiler or CMake is present, but it is the test that actually enforces the
property — the structural checks below can only catch the one route by which
the coupling was reintroduced, and a behaviour has to be checked by running it.
