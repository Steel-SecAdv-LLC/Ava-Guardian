"""Negative controls for ``tools/check_release_tag.py`` (INVARIANT-2).

A gate with no negative control has not been shown to be a gate. This module
builds throwaway repositories carrying each tag shape the gate is supposed to
distinguish and asserts the verdict on every one of them:

======================  =======  ==========================================
shape                   verdict  why it is the shape it is
======================  =======  ==========================================
missing                 FAIL     nothing to release from
lightweight             FAIL     ref -> commit; no object to sign
annotated, unsigned     FAIL     the shape of five of this repo's own tags
annotated, PGP-signed   PASS
annotated, SSH-signed   PASS
annotated, X.509-signed PASS
======================  =======  ==========================================

The three passing fixtures embed a signature *block* that is not a real
signature. That is deliberate and it is exactly what the tool claims to check:
its docstring states it verifies shape, not cryptography. A fixture that had to
carry a genuine signature would need a private key in the test suite, which
INVARIANT-17 forbids outright.

(The repository *does* ship a trust store — ``.github/allowed_signers`` — and
``tests/test_release_tag_trust_store.py`` performs the real cryptographic check
against it, on a real signature, with no private key anywhere. This module and
that one draw different lines on purpose: shape here, attribution there.)

The line these tests draw is the line the tool draws — and the
``test_a_real_signature_is_not_required`` case says so out loud so nobody later
reads a PASS here as a cryptographic result.

Tag objects are written with ``git hash-object -t tag`` rather than
``git tag -s`` for the same reason: ``git tag -s`` would need a configured
signing key, and the point is to exercise the parser against every shape
including ones no local key could produce.
