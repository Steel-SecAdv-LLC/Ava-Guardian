Tests for ``tools/check_compiler_warnings.py``.

The gate this covers replaced a chain of ``grep -v`` inside one workflow step.
That chain had already broken once in this branch's history — its allowlist
matched ASCII apostrophes while ``LANG=C.UTF-8`` makes GCC quote identifiers
with U+2018/U+2019, so the step failed on the exact class it exists to permit —
and it passed vacuously when its log was missing, because ``grep``'s exit 2
flattened into "no warnings found".

So both directions are pinned here, not just the happy path: every exemption is
shown to admit its own class in *both* quote spellings, a real out-of-allowlist
diagnostic is shown to fail, and a missing or empty log is shown to be fatal
rather than clean.  The out-of-allowlist samples are verbatim lines from real
builds of this tree, not invented text.
