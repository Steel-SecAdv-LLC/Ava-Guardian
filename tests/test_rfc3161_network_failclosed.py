"""Item 19 — the RFC 3161 TSA path fails CLOSED under real network faults.

``tests/test_rfc3161_offline.py`` exercises mock and disabled modes; this file
exercises the ONE networked path in the shipped library
(``request_timestamp_exchange`` / ``request_timestamp_token`` /
``get_timestamp`` -> ``http.client.HTTPSConnection``) against faults induced at
the socket/DNS layer, NOT via mocks:

  * dead DNS      — an RFC 6761 ``.invalid`` host that cannot resolve;
  * unreachable   — RFC 5737 TEST-NET-1 (192.0.2.1), which is guaranteed not
                    to be routed, so the connect stalls until the timeout;
  * refused       — 127.0.0.1 on a port with no listener;
  * mid-handshake — a local socket that accepts the TCP connection and then
                    closes it before the TLS handshake completes.

Every case must raise ``TimestampError`` (or ``ValueError`` for a rejected
URL) — never return a token, never hang past the library's own deadline, and
never leak a raw ``OSError``/``ssl.SSLError`` to the caller. Keeping these in
the suite is the item's explicit requirement.

These tests make no outbound connection to any real TSA: TEST-NET-1 is
unrouted, ``.invalid`` never resolves, and the refused/mid-handshake cases talk
to a loopback socket this process owns. ``http.client.HTTPSConnection`` does
not consult HTTP(S)_PROXY, so the loopback and unrouted targets are hit
directly.
