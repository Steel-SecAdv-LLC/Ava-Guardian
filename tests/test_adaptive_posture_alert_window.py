"""A flood of low-value alerts must not evict a genuine critical before scoring.

Alert-window suppression: ``get_security_report`` returned only
``recent_alerts`` — the last TEN entries — and the posture
evaluator scored that window.  An attacker who emits >=10 non-scored-type
alerts (``volume_spike``, ``note_artifact``, ...) immediately after a real
timing/pattern critical pushes that critical out of the ten-entry window before
the next poll, so it is never scored and escalation is silently suppressed.

The fix adds ``scorable_alerts`` — the full retained alert list — to the report
and makes the evaluator score that when present, falling back to
``recent_alerts`` only when it is absent.  The per-evaluation cursor still
scores each alert exactly once, so widening the input cannot double-count.

These tests pin BOTH halves: that the monitor emits the full list, and that the
evaluator scores the buried critical from it — with the fallback path retained
as an explicit witness of the pre-fix suppression.
