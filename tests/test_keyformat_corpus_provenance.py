"""Automated provenance checks for the vendored key-format conformance corpus.

``tools/build_keyformat_corpus.py`` re-derives ``tests/kat/keyformats/`` from
the documents the bytes came from. Its ``--verify`` half runs offline and
checks the properties ``tests/test_key_formats.py`` cannot: that every corpus
file is *present*, that each one records the exact document revision it was
extracted from, that every record's PEM body is well-formed DER, and that the
deliberately-inconsistent PQ records still exist.

Until this module was written that verifier ran only when a human typed the
command. ``tools/refresh_wycheproof_corpus.py`` has had
``tests/test_wycheproof_corpus_provenance.py`` driving its offline half since
the Wycheproof corpus landed; this is the same contract for the same class of
artefact, and it is deliberately written to the same shape.

Both directions are pinned. A provenance check that cannot fail is not a
provenance check, so every class of problem the verifier reports is reproduced
here against a scratch copy of the corpus and required to be caught.
