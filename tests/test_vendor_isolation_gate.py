Tests for ``tools/check_vendor_isolation.py`` (INVARIANT-1).

The gate exists because "no third-party cryptographic implementation is linked,
imported or called" was, before it, enforced against *subprocess invocations*
only (``tools/check_corpus_originality.py``) and otherwise asserted by comments
and intent.  A control that has never been shown to fail is indistinguishable
from one that cannot, so every check here is exercised in both directions:

* the **source** check must flag a vendor import, a ``ctypes`` load naming a
  vendor library, and an import of the comparator package;
* the **library** check must flag a genuinely OpenSSL-linked object — the
  interpreter's own ``_ssl`` extension is used as the positive control, so the
  ELF/Mach-O/PE parsing is validated against a real binary rather than a
  fixture;
* the parsers must agree with the platform's own tools where those exist;
* and a check whose evidence is absent (missing library, unparseable file, a
  package directory with no sources) must be a failure, not a silent pass.
