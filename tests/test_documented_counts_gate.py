"""Negative controls for ``tools/check_documented_counts.py``.

The gate re-derives every count the documentation pins, on the argument that
"a documented number that has quietly gone wrong is worse than no number,
because a reader takes it as evidence". It was itself unpinned — mentioned in
prose by ``test_documented_examples.py`` and driven by nothing.

That mattered, and the way it mattered is the reason this module exists.
``docs/METRICS_REPORT.md`` carries two different file counts one table apart:
the Lines-of-Code table's ``Files`` column, and "Python test files under
``tests/`` matching the static regex". They are different measures — a raw glob
against a ``def test_`` match — that happened to print the same number. Only
the second was gated. When they diverged, the gated one stayed right and the
ungated one silently went stale, in the document that declares itself
authoritative and says "if a documented count and this report disagree, the
count is the bug". A row whose neighbour is checked reads as checked.

Both directions are pinned below: a wrong number must fail, a renamed row must
fail rather than silently stop being checked, and a correct tree must pass.
The last is not a formality — a checker that reports drift unconditionally is
as useless as one that never does, and rather more likely to be switched off.
