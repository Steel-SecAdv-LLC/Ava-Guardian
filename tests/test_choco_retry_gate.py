"""The Chocolatey retry policy, and the gate that keeps every call inside it.

Chocolatey v2 exits 0 when it installs nothing.  On 2026-08-21 the community
feed returned 503 and every Windows lane in both workflows went red on
PR #394::

    Failed to fetch results from V2 feed at '...' : 503 (Service Unavailable).
    Unable to find package 'softhsm.install'.
    Chocolatey installed 0/0 packages.

``$LASTEXITCODE`` was 0 for that run, and all four retry loops in the
workflows read ``if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) { break }`` — so ``Attempt 1/5``
"succeeded", the loop broke, and the step failed one line later at its
post-condition with no retry ever attempted.

Both halves are pinned here: the gate that forbids a bare ``choco install``,
and the helper's actual behaviour, executed.  The second half is the one that
matters — a retry that cannot see the failure it exists for is decoration, and
only running it proves otherwise.
