# D-9: Preflight version checks for every build-time dependency listed in
# pyproject.toml's [build-system].requires.  Each floor here is kept IDENTICAL
# to the version pinned there, so the guard enforces exactly what an isolated
# PEP 517 build installs — the comment "enforced by setup.py's preflight check"
# is factually accurate (Copilot review #5 / D-9-extended).
#
#   * setuptools >= 83.0.0:  Debian's patched setuptools 68.x raises
#     AttributeError(install_layout) deep inside pip's bdist_wheel subprocess.
#     70.0.0 closes GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5 and 78.1.1 closes PYSEC-2025-49; the
#     floor is pinned at 83.0.0 to match pyproject.toml's [build-system].
#   * wheel >= 0.47.0:        closes GHSA-8rrh-rw8j-w5fx.
#   * cmake >= 4.4.0:         supply-chain floor (matches pyproject.toml's
#     [build-system].requires).  CMakeLists.txt's cmake_minimum_required is
#     3.15, but this higher floor is enforced for supply-chain security.
#   * Cython >= 3.2.8:        floor for the math_engine extension's
#     `cimport numpy` typed-memoryview surface.
#   * numpy >= 1.24.0:        provides the `numpy.pxd` headers the Cython
#     extension absorbs at C-compile time.
#
# Failing fast with a single FATAL message is far better than the opaque
# downstream errors users would otherwise see (AttributeError deep inside
# pip's wheel-build subprocess; "numpy.pxd not found" inside Cython's
# cythonize call; cmake_minimum_required abort; etc.).
#
# Version comparison goes through packaging.version.Version when available
# (handles PEP 440 + Debian-style local/build suffixes like "70.0.0+deb"
# and "70.0.0-1" — Copilot review #6).  When packaging is unavailable
# (very old build environments), we pad the digit-only tuple to length 3
# so 70.0+ still satisfies (70, 0, 0).

# Run the preflight before any setuptools imports below — the Debian
# install_layout regression fires inside setuptools' own __init__ paths
# during bdist_wheel, so a check that runs after `from setuptools import
# Extension` would race the very failure mode it is meant to prevent.
# setuptools and wheel are checked unconditionally — they are required
# for any setup.py invocation regardless of whether Cython is enabled.
# Cython and numpy are only required when the math_engine Cython
# extension is being built; the documented ``AMA_NO_CYTHON=1`` opt-out
# (and its companion ``AMA_NO_C_EXTENSIONS=1``, which empties the Cython
# extension list — the native library itself is built via CMake in every
# configuration) must therefore skip those preflight checks.  Copilot reviews #12/#15/#22 and Devin review #13
# observed that the previous form ran every floor unconditionally,
# turning a documented opt-out into an unconditional FATAL when the
# environment lacked Cython/numpy (e.g. minimal embedded builders or
# ``pip install --no-build-isolation`` against a host without
# Cython/numpy).  pyproject.toml's [build-system].requires comment
# already reads "FATAL unless AMA_NO_CYTHON=1"; this brings the runtime
# behaviour in line with the documented contract.

# has_ext_modules() return True in every configuration: `build` always

    """Declares this distribution native, whether or not it has ext_modules.

    Two things read ``Distribution.has_ext_modules()``, and both were wrong
    for this package whenever ``ext_modules`` came back empty:

    1. ``build.sub_commands`` gates ``build_ext`` on it.  Every one of the six
       binding Extensions is declared inside ``if USE_CYTHON:`` in
       ``get_extension_modules()``, so ``AMA_NO_CYTHON=1`` (and
       ``AMA_NO_C_EXTENSIONS=1``) empties the list, setuptools skips
       ``build_ext`` entirely, and ``CMakeBuild.run`` — the ONLY caller of
       ``_build_cmake`` and ``_copy_native_library_into_package`` — never
       runs.  The resulting wheel contained no ``libama_cryptography.so`` at
       all, so the install imported straight into
       ``CryptoModuleError: no native library found in any of 17 searched
       directories``.  Measured on 3baf6c3 and on ``origin/main`` before it:
       ``AMA_NO_CYTHON=1 pip install .`` exits 0 and produces an install that
       cannot import.  README, ENHANCED_FEATURES.md and IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE
       all list the variable as a supported "pure Python" mode, and setup.py
       itself prints ``AMA_NO_CYTHON=1 pip install .`` as the escape from a
       fatal Cython error — an escape into a broken install.
    2. ``bdist_wheel.root_is_pure`` derives from it, so that same build was
       tagged ``py3-none-any``.  A pure tag on a distribution whose only
       working form ships a platform-specific shared object is a wheel that
       installs anywhere and works nowhere.  With this class it is tagged
       ``cp3XX-cp3XX-<platform>``, which is over-specific rather than wrong:
       without binding extensions the package would in fact run on any
       CPython >= 3.10, but a native artefact must never carry ``any``.

    There is no configuration in which this package is pure.  INVARIANT-7
    forbids operating without the native backend, and POST enforces it at
    import, so "pure Python AMA Cryptography" is not a degraded mode — it is
    a module that refuses to initialise.  The Cython switches select whether
    the optional Python BINDINGS are built; they never selected whether the
    library itself is.

        copy of the package and the staging build_lib copy so the wheel
        builder picks it up exactly the way it picks up _integrity_digest.txt.
        AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1 is set on the child below unconditionally: it is
        _build_sign's own "a build, not a user re-blessing an installed tree"
        gate, and this IS the build.

        This used to return early unless the caller had already exported
        AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1, on the stated ground that "plain `pip install .`
        from a source checkout is unaffected — those users get the digest-only
        fallback (logged WARNING at import time)".  Measured, that fallback is
        not a warning-shaped inconvenience.  A plain `pip install .` shipped
        six binding extensions with ``INTEGRITY_BINDING_DIGESTS_HEX = {}``,
        which produced, per interpreter start: twelve "present but not covered
        by the signed artefact" lines, a POST verdict of "1 of 13 tests were
        SKIPPED — this module is NOT fully verified", and — because
        _check_binding_extensions treats uncovered inventory as a hard failure
        on any build carrying a trust anchor — a CryptoModuleError under
        AMA_FIPS_STRICT=1, the variable SECURITY.md tells release deployments
        to set.  README names `pip install .` the primary install channel and
        it is the only one that works while PyPI is unpublished, so the
        default path produced the loudest possible unverified state.

        The native library is built unconditionally a few lines above (a
        missing CMake is already FATAL), so there is no build that reaches
        here without something to sign.  A signer failure therefore fails the
        build rather than downgrading it: an artefact that cannot be produced
        is a broken install, not a developer convenience.

        D-1 — without this step the produced wheel ships only the Cython
        binding `.so` files; they NEEDED-link against the library's current
        SONAME (`libama_cryptography.so.<major>`, `.so.5` at this release —
        CMake derives SOVERSION from the project major, so this tracks the
        version rather than being a fixed name), which is not present anywhere
        on a fresh install, so any
        `python -m ama_cryptography` invocation outside the source tree dies
        with `RuntimeError: AMA native C library required`.

        We copy into TWO locations on every invocation:

          (1) the in-tree source dir (./ama_cryptography/) — required for
              `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` so an editable / source
              checkout can `import ama_cryptography` directly;
          (2) the staging dir <build_lib>/ama_cryptography/ — required for
              `pip install` / `python -m build` flows, because setuptools'
              wheel-builder collects package files from the staging dir,
              not from the source tree.  Putting them ONLY in the source
              tree was the original D-1 root cause: the wheel never
              picked them up and the install ended in a broken state.

        We preserve the SONAME chain
            libama_cryptography.so -> .so.<major> -> .so.<major>.<minor>.<patch>
        (`.so.5` -> `.so.5.0.0` at this release; CMake derives SOVERSION from
        the project major, so the chain tracks the version rather than being a
        fixed name) so the dynamic loader resolves the binding extensions'
