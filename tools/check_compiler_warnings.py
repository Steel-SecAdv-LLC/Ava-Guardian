AMA Cryptography — Frozen Compiler-Warning Allowlist
====================================================

Fails the build if any compiler warning appears outside a short, explicitly
justified allowlist.  This is the enforcement half of the "Strict Compiler
Warnings" jobs in ``.github/workflows/static-analysis.yml``; the jobs produce
the logs, this script decides.

Why this is a script and not three copies of a shell pipeline
-------------------------------------------------------------
The allowlist used to live inline in one workflow step as a chain of
``grep -v``.  That had two consequences, and the second is the reason this
file exists.

``the allowlist could not be reused``
    The step ran in exactly one configuration — x86-64, one compiler at a
    time, **no** ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` — and its conclusion ("no warnings
    beyond the two documented extension classes") was reported as a
    property of the repository.  It was a property of that
    configuration.  Two whole classes of diagnostic were unreachable from it:

    *optimizer-dependent warnings*
        ``-Wmaybe-uninitialized``, ``-Wstringop-truncation``,
        ``-Wstringop-overflow``, ``-Wrestrict`` and everything
        ``_FORTIFY_SOURCE`` derives are computed from dataflow the optimizer
        builds.  At ``-O0`` GCC emits none of them.  Measured on the commit
        that introduced this script: the tree compiled at ``-O0`` produced
        zero warnings outside the allowlist, and the same tree compiled
        ``Release`` produced seven ``-Wstringop-truncation`` in
        ``benchmarks/benchmark_c_raw.c`` — plus, with LTO on (the
        configuration ``make c`` and the release wheels use), a
        ``'pk_k' may be used uninitialized`` for a keypair call whose return
        value was discarded.

    *architecture-dependent warnings*
        ``src/c/neon/**`` and ``src/c/sve2/**`` compile to a placeholder
        typedef on x86-64.  On AArch64 they compiled 36
        ``-Wmissing-prototypes`` — a class the same job makes **fatal** with
        ``-Werror=missing-prototypes`` — because the kernels' prototypes were
        hand-transcribed at each consumer instead of living in a header.  A
        gate that is ``-Werror`` on a class the build carries 36 instances of
        is not enforcing that class; it is not looking at it.

``a gate whose input vanished passed``
    ``grep`` exits 2 with "No such file or directory", which ``|| true``
    flattened into the same empty result as "no warnings found".  That is
    handled here by refusing to run against a missing or empty log.

Both configurations and both architectures now feed this one allowlist.

What is allowed, and why
------------------------
(There is no vendored C source: the tree's one vendored backend was removed
in the twenty-first maintenance pass, and its exemption with it.)

``fe51.h`` / ``fe64.h`` — ``ISO C does not support '__int128' types``
    ``-Wpedantic`` under GCC.  The 128-bit limbs are what the field
    arithmetic is built on; there is no ISO C spelling of them.

``x86/ama_nistp_mont_mulx.c`` — ``string literal of length``
    ``-Woverlength-strings`` under clang.  One atomic ``asm()`` block:
    splitting the Montgomery kernel into several ``asm`` statements would
    forfeit the register-state guarantees the kernel depends on, and the
    warning measures the concatenated literal anyway.

Tightening (a class driven to zero) means deleting its entry below.
Loosening requires editing this file in review — which is the point.

Usage
-----
::

    python3 tools/check_compiler_warnings.py build-warnings.log [more.log ...]

Exit codes
----------
``0``
    Every warning in every log matched the allowlist.
``1``
    A warning outside the allowlist was found, or a log was missing/empty.
``2``
    Usage error.

#: Lines that are compiler DIAGNOSTICS.

#: clang's per-translation-unit SUMMARY line, ``1 warning generated.``.
#:
#: An earlier form (``\bwarning[ :]``) matched that summary, so every clang
#: build reported one bogus finding per file that emitted any warning — twelve
#: of them across the two clang configurations, all of them the summary of
#: warnings this allowlist had already excused.  It went unnoticed until the

#: fires on its own bookkeeping is as useless as one that cannot fire.

#: GCC quotes identifiers with U+2018/U+2019 under a UTF-8 locale and with
