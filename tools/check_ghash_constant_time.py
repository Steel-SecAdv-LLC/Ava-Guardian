AMA Cryptography — scalar AES-GCM instruction-count invariance (INVARIANT-6)
============================================================================

Asserts that the **scalar** AES-256-GCM path retires the same number of
instructions regardless of the key, and therefore regardless of the GHASH
subkey ``H = E_K(0^128)`` derived from it.

Why this exists
---------------
``src/c/ama_aes_gcm.c`` accumulates GHASH with a branch-free mask::

    mask = 0 - bit_of(Z)          # 0x00 or 0xFF
    for k in 0..15: out[k] ^= V[k] & mask

That is constant-time in the C abstract machine only.  An optimizer may
prove the mask is all-zero-or-all-ones, recognise the masked accumulate as the
identity in the all-zero case, and emit a branch over it — putting a branch back on a
bit of the running accumulator, which is a function of the secret ``H`` from
the second block onward.  clang 18 at ``-O2``/``-O3`` did exactly that; gcc
13 did not.  Both builds pass every functional test, because the *results*
are identical.  Only the emitted control flow differs, so only a check that
looks at execution rather than at output can see it.

The source-level defence is ``ama_ct_value_barrier_u64`` (see
``src/c/internal/ama_ct_barrier.h``); ``ghash_mul`` accumulates on 64-bit
words, so the word-width form is the one it uses.  This gate is what stops the
defence from being silently removed, or from being defeated by a compiler
nobody has tried yet.

Method
------
Retired-instruction counts under ``valgrind --tool=callgrind``, not wall
time.  Callgrind counts are deterministic to within a handful of
instructions, so this needs no statistics, no repetitions for significance,
and no quiet machine — it is a functional check that happens to be about
timing, and it gives the same verdict on a loaded CI runner as on idle
hardware.

Three measurements:

* **Floor** — the same key twice.  Whatever this differs by is process-level
  noise (loader, glibc), and it bounds the resolution of the comparison.
* **Signal** — distinct key classes against each other.
* **Verdict** — fail if any cross-key delta exceeds ``--threshold``.

Calibration (x86-64, 8 encryptions of 512 B with 64 B AAD, scalar path forced).
The table below is illustrative of the failure mode — a value-dependent branch
the optimizer introduces around a masked accumulate, which the value barrier
(``ama_ct_value_barrier_u64``) denies it:

===================================  ==================
build                                cross-key delta
===================================  ==================
clang -O3 without the value barrier  3,226 instructions
clang -O3 with the value barrier             12
same key, two runs (noise floor)       up to 25
===================================  ==================

**This "clang -O3" figure does not reproduce on the compilers available today
(audit M24).** Removing the ``__asm__`` from ``ama_ct_value_barrier_u64`` and
rebuilding ``ama_aes_gcm.c -O3 -DAMA_AES_CONSTTIME=1``: under ``clang 18.1.3`` the
object is BYTE-IDENTICAL with and without the barrier; under ``gcc 13`` it differs
only in register allocation, with the SAME conditional-branch count (100 vs 100).
Neither currently-available compiler reintroduces the branch the 3,226 row
describes, so that row is attributed to a compiler version / flag set no longer
identified here.  The barrier is therefore kept as **forward insurance** against a
compiler that does perform the conversion, not as a signal this gate reproduces on
today's toolchain; the operative measurement is the per-target limits below (all
zero), which the gate DOES reproduce on both gcc 13 and clang 18.

Per-target limits are set from measurement, not from headroom: all EIGHTEEN
targets measure a cross-class delta of exactly zero under both gcc 13 and
clang 18 at -O3, with a same-class floor of exactly zero, and every limit is
0.  `ecdsa` was the last holdout — it carried a limit of 64 for the DER
length term — and reached zero the way `nistp-ecdsa` did, by signing through
the fixed-width `ama_secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_raw` entry point so the encoder is
outside the measurement rather than inside it with an allowance.  The full
measurement table and the reasoning are at ``THRESHOLDS`` below.

Exit status
-----------
``0`` invariant holds, ``1`` a key-dependent instruction count was measured,
``2`` the check could not run (missing valgrind, compiler, or library, or a
noise floor so high the comparison would be meaningless).  As elsewhere in
``tools/``, an unrunnable check is never reported as a passing one.

#: Fallback limit for a target with no entry in :data:`THRESHOLDS`.  Zero,
#: because that is what a deterministic instrument measures on code with no
#: benign variable-time step; a new target that genuinely has one states its
#: own limit and the measurement behind it.
DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0

#: Key classes to compare.  Single characters so the driver's argument
#: handling costs the same for each — a multi-character argument would make
#: strtoul-style parsing itself key-dependent and pollute the measurement.
#:
#: Eight rather than four.  This is a *sampling* check: it detects a
#: secret-dependent path only if two of the keys it happens to try land on
#: different sides of the predicate.  With four keys the secp256k1 carry-fold
#: and low-s leaks showed a 288-instruction spread, against 576 over twenty —
#: i.e. four keys saw half the effect available, and a smaller leak could sit
#: entirely inside one class.  Each additional class costs ~0.4 s on the ecdsa
#: target and ~5 s on ghash, which buys detection power cheaply.
#:
#: Printable ASCII only: the value reaches the driver as `argv[1][0]`, and a
#: non-ASCII character would be UTF-8 encoded by the caller into two bytes,
#: so the driver would silently see the lead byte and two "different" classes
#: could collide.
KEY_CLASSES = ("A", "Z", "m", "q", "0", "~", "!", "5")

#: Per-target instruction-count threshold.
#:
#: ghash: the scalar AES-GCM path is deterministic end to end, so anything
#: above process noise is a defect.  Calibration in the module docstring.
#:
#: ecdsa: secp256k1 signing HAD one *legitimate* variable-time step — DER
#: encoding of r and s, whose leading-zero handling depends on the signature
#: values.  Those are public (the verifier receives them), which is why a
#: non-zero limit was defensible.  It is history now, not the current
#: rationale: this target signs through `ama_secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_raw`, a
#: fixed-width 64-octet entry point, so the encoder is not in the measurement
#: at all and the limit is 0 like every other target.  The paragraphs below
#: record how that limit came down, because the numbers in them are the
#: evidence for the value it came down to.
#:
#: This threshold was 3,000, calibrated against the Montgomery
#: extra-reduction leak (33,354 instructions) and an apparent benign spread
#: of 728.  Both halves of that calibration were wrong in the same direction.
#: The 728 was not benign — most of it was two *further* live leaks in the
#: same file, sc_add's carry fold and sc_is_high's short-circuited memcmp,
#: which this gate was passing over.  And ~9 instructions per byte of the
#: remainder came from the driver consuming `siglen` bytes rather than a
#: fixed count, which is measurement noise the gate itself created.
#:
#: Re-measured on the configuration CI actually runs — the AMA_TESTING_MODE
#: static archive, LTO off, 8 key classes, driver consuming a fixed byte
#: count:
#:
#: ==========================================  ==================
#: build                                       cross-key delta
#: ==========================================  ==================
#: pre-fix secp256k1 (git-reverted control)    2,952 instructions
#: fixed (shipped), at the time                   80
#: fixed (shipped), re-measured                   24  (gcc 13 -O3)
#:                                                16  (clang 18 -O3)
#: ==========================================  ==================
#:
#: The 80 predates the driver consuming a fixed byte count rather than
#: iterating to `siglen`; that change removed the ~9 instructions per byte of
#: noise the driver was creating itself, and what is left is the library's own
#: DER encoding. Both re-measurements are on the archive build the workflow
#: configures (Release, LTO off), which is the configuration the limit has to
#: be safe for.
#:
#: The old threshold of 3,000 therefore sat **48 instructions above the
#: defect it was measuring**.  It was never going to fire.  Its replacement,
#: a flat 200, then sat 2.5x above the benign floor — and 8 signatures of
#: amplification made that 25 instructions per signature of real divergence
#: this target would still have passed.  The limit is now 64; see the
#: measurement table below.
#:
#: (On a shared-library build the same comparison reads 576 against 24; the
#: absolute numbers move with linkage and codegen, the ratio does not.  Quote
#: the archive numbers, because that is what the workflow builds.)
#:
#: The general lesson is recorded because it will recur: a threshold set
#: between one known defect and one *assumed* noise floor is only as good as
#: the assumption. The noise floor has to be measured on a build believed
#: clean, and "believed clean" has to be earned by looking, not by the
#: absence of a red gate.
#:
#: consttime: ama_consttime_memcmp is a fixed-count XOR accumulator over
#: volatile pointers, so its retired count is invariant by construction —
#: measured byte-identical (37,157,290) across all eight classes, covering the
#: equal case and a first-difference at eight positions spread through a 4 KiB
#: buffer. There is no benign spread to accommodate, which is why its limit
#: is 0 rather than a shared allowance.
#:
#: This target exists because the dudect lane for the same function is a
#: *wall-clock* statistical test on a shared CI runner, and it flakes: it
#: failed at |t| = 5.21 against a 4.5 threshold in 2 of 3 rounds on a commit
#: that did not touch src/c/ama_consttime.c, on a function whose instruction
#: count does not move at all. This module's own docstring already makes the
#: argument — callgrind counts "give the same verdict on a loaded CI runner as
#: on idle hardware" — so the durable answer to a flaky timing lane over a
#: deterministic function is to also measure it deterministically. dudect stays
#: as the wall-clock cross-check; this is what a real regression trips.
#: THE LIMITS BELOW ARE MEASURED, NOT ROUNDED
#: ------------------------------------------
#: Every target used to share a flat 200, chosen for `ecdsa` and applied to
#: the rest as "pure headroom".  Headroom in a deterministic instrument is not
#: free: what it buys is the right to pass a real divergence.  A target's
#: sensitivity is its limit divided by its amplification — the number of
#: operations its driver runs — so a flat 200 meant:
#:
#: =============  =============  =====================================
#: target         operations     per-operation divergence that PASSED
#: =============  =============  =====================================
#: nistp-ecdsa          4              50 instructions per signature
#: ghash                8              25 per encryption
#: ecdsa                8              25 per signature
#: x25519               8              25 per scalar multiplication
#: kyber-decaps        60               3 per decapsulation
#: ed25519-sign       200               1 per signature
#: aead-verify        500               0 (1 per call amplifies to 500)
#: consttime         2000               0
#: ascon-hash        2000               0
#: ascon-encrypt     2000               0
#: agent-binding     2000               0
#: sha3-256          2000               0
#: =============  =============  =====================================
#:
#: `ed25519-sign` is the sharpest: 200 operations against a limit of 200, and
#: the verdict is `>` — so a one-instruction-per-signature key-dependent
#: divergence, which is what a conditional branch on a secret bit looks like
#: after the optimizer gets to it, passed this gate exactly.  The nistp leak
#: this file already records was 313 instructions per signature; the same gate
#: would not have seen it at 50.
#:
#: That is not an argument from arithmetic.  It was measured, by putting the
#: defect back: one branch on `private_key[0] & 1`, executed once per
#: signature, at the top of `ama_nistp_ecdsa_sign_raw` in src/c/ama_nistp.c,
#: on the archive build the workflow configures.  The cross-key delta is 12
#: retired instructions and 8 data references — and at a limit of 200 this
#: tool printed
#:
#:     NISTP-ECDSA CONSTANT-TIME CHECK PASSED — instruction count, data
#:     references and cache misses are all key-independent
#:
#: over code with a live branch on the private key, exit 0.  At the limits
#: below it fails, exit 1, naming both metrics.  The mutation was reverted;
#: what it establishes is that the old margin was not headroom, it was a
#: blind spot of a size real defects come in.
#:
#: So each limit is now what the measurement supports.  Measured on this tree
#: with the AMA_TESTING_MODE static archive, LTO off, 8 key classes, at -O3
#: under both compilers CI uses:

#:
#: All eighteen are exactly zero, on both compilers, with a same-class floor of
#: exactly zero — which is what "deterministic instrument" has to mean.  Their
#: limit is 0.  A single retired instruction of cross-class
#: difference in any of them falsifies the property the target states, and
#: there is nothing left for a threshold to be headroom FOR: the floor check
#: already reports INCONCLUSIVE (exit 2) rather than passing if the
#: environment cannot reproduce itself, so a host with real measurement noise
#: is diagnosed instead of silently absorbed.
#:
#: `nistp-ecdsa` reached zero by construction rather than by luck: its driver
#: now signs with `ama_nistp_ecdsa_sign_raw`, identical arithmetic to the DER
#: entry point with a fixed-width 64-octet result, so the DER encoder's
#: length variance — a public-value term, but a key-dependent one — is no
#: longer inside the measurement at all.
#:
#: `ecdsa` was the last holdout and is now closed the same way.  secp256k1
#: used to expose only the DER form, so the leading-zero handling of r and s
#: stayed in the count — 24 instructions over 8 signatures under gcc, 16 under
#: clang — and the target carried a limit of 64.  That was a tolerance of 8
#: instructions per signature, and a secret-dependent divergence smaller than
#: that was below what the target could resolve.
#:
#: `ama_secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_raw` emits a constant 64 octets from identical
#: arithmetic, so the encoder is no longer inside the measurement.  Measured
#: on this tree, all eight key classes are byte-identical under both
#: compilers:
#:
#:     gcc 13    11,645,734 I refs   2,082,049 D refs   1,706 D1   1,456 LLd
#:     clang 18  11,948,072 I refs   3,202,907 D refs   1,713 D1   1,464 LLd
#:
#: with a same-class floor of zero.  The limit is 0.  The two entry points are
#: not assumed equivalent: tests/c/test_secp256k1.c decodes the DER signature
#: back to (r, s) and compares it against r||s over 512 keys, and asserts the
#: comparison saw at least one short DER signature so it cannot pass over
#: full-length cases alone.
#:
#: `x25519-batch` is the thirteenth of the eighteen, and it exists because a
#: lane can be
#: informational only where something else blocks.  `tests/c/test_dudect.c`
#: registers eight info-only wall-clock lanes, and each one that names a reason
#: names a deterministic counterpart: `Kyber-1024 decaps` cites `kyber-decaps`,
#: `secp256k1 ECDSA sign` cites `ecdsa`.  Two had none — `ML-DSA-65 sign` and
#: `SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f sign`, both of which drive a rejection loop whose
#: iteration count is a function of the secret, so a zero-delta instruction
#: count is not merely absent but impossible (see CONSTANT_TIME_VERIFICATION.md,
#: "Rejection sampling and what these gates cannot cover") — and a third,
#: `X25519 scalarmult batch x4`, had none for no reason at all: the property is
#: the same one `x25519` states, over a DIFFERENT entry point.
#:
#: `ama_x25519_scalarmult_batch` carries its own four-lane chunker, the AVX2
#: 4-way kernel behind `AMA_DISPATCH_USE_X25519_AVX2`, a scalar tail, and an
#: aggregated low-order rejection that must zero every output when any lane
#: rejects.  The `x25519` target reaches none of that; it measures the
#: single-shot entry point.  Measured on this tree at count = 4 (the smallest
#: batch that takes the full-chunk path), all eight key classes byte-identical
#: on all four metrics, on BOTH dispatch wirings:
#:

#:
#: The AVX2 4-way kernel had never been measured by a deterministic instrument
#: before; its only coverage was the info-only wall-clock lane.  The gate is

 * data-reference and miss figures rule out a secret-dependent memory access,
 * which an instruction count alone cannot see.  (The absolute figures for the
 * measuring commit are in CHANGELOG.md; the zero deltas are the invariant.
 * An earlier revision of this comment quoted counts taken on an unoptimized
 * build and argued the 5.630 ns was "one part in 90,000" of a decapsulation —
 * withdrawn: a mispredicted branch costs a fixed 5-20 ns whatever surrounds
 * it, so the ratio excludes nothing.  The identity above is the argument.)
 * The residual wall-clock difference needs no exotic explanation and an
 * earlier revision's appeal to data-operand-dependent latency (Intel DOITM,
 * ARM PSTATE.DIT) is withdrawn.  The lane that produced it selected its
 * ciphertext with `class_idx ? ct_bad : ct`, a branch perfectly correlated
 * with the class sitting between the class draw and the opening timer.  Run
 * as a null experiment — byte-identical ciphertexts in both classes, true
 * effect exactly zero, 200,000 measurements, 5 runs — that construction is
 * over threshold in 3 of 5 runs at worst |t| = 6.99, every excursion one
 * sign; the masked-merge staging the lane now uses is 0 of 5.  The excursion
 * was the instrument's, not the primitive's.
 *
 * THE STAGING BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING.  Handing the timed call `ct` for one class
 * and `ct_bad` for the other confounds the class with the ciphertext's ADDRESS:
 * measured that way at -O3 this same driver reports a reproducible ~175-miss
 * D1 delta with the instruction count unchanged — a "finding" that belongs

/* Ed25519 signing with the SECRET KEY as the class variable.
 *
 * Why this target exists.  The wall-clock lane in
 * tools/constant_time/dudect_crypto.c reported t = -6.71 for Ed25519 sign in
 * 4 of 5 rounds, consistently signed, on the same CI run that flagged
 * SHA3-256 — and passed (-2.40) on the immediately preceding commit, which
 * differed by no C code at all.
 *
 * This is the lane that matters most of the three, because unlike a hash the
 * class variable here IS the long-term secret: a real input-dependence would
 * be a key-recovery surface, not a nuisance.  So it gets the deterministic
 * instrument rather than an argument from the wall clock.
 *
 * Ed25519 signing is deterministic (RFC 8032 §5.1.6 derives the nonce from
 * the key and message), so for a fixed message the retired-instruction count
 * is a pure function of the secret key.  Constant-time signing means that
 * function is constant.  The scalar multiplication is a fixed-window comb
 * over the base point and the SHA-512 core is branchless, so an
 * input-independent count is the expected result and a delta localises the
 * defect to src/c/ama_ed25519.c.
 *
 * The class byte becomes the 32-byte seed, mirroring the dudect lane's
 * all-zero vs all-0xFF seeds but spreading the byte so the classes land on
 * different sides of any secret-dependent predicate rather than only on the
 * two Hamming extremes.  The message is FIXED: varying it would make the
 * count vary for a legitimate reason (message length feeds the SHA-512 block
 * count) and mask the property under test. */

    A count is only evidence about the code it actually executed.  Because the

    a report that does not name the wiring leaves the reader unable to tell
    which of the two the delta covers — and before `AMA_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOTUNE`
    was set above, that choice was made by a wall-clock benchmark of whatever
    machine happened to run the gate.  So the wiring is printed beside the
    counts rather than assumed.

    Run UNDER VALGRIND, which is not incidental.  Valgrind emulates CPUID and
    reports only the ISA extensions it implements, so a capability the host has
    and Valgrind does not is invisible to the dispatcher inside the
    measurement.  Measured on an AVX-512 host: natively the library reports
    ``AVX2=1 AVX-512F=1 AVX-512-Keccak=1``, and under callgrind the same binary
    reports ``AVX2=1 AVX-512F=0 AVX-512-Keccak=0``.  This function used to run
    the driver natively and print that first line beside counts taken with the
    second, i.e. it named a wiring the numbers did not cover — the exact defect
    its own docstring says it exists to prevent.

    The consequence is worth stating rather than hiding, because it bounds what
    this gate can claim: with ``-DAMA_ENABLE_AVX512=ON`` the library wires
    ``keccak_f1600_x4`` to the AVX-512 kernel on capable silicon, and no run of
    this tool can execute that kernel.  The report now says so in the wiring
    line instead of leaving the reader to assume otherwise.  (In the shipped
    configuration the question is moot: ``AMA_ENABLE_AVX512`` defaults OFF and
    ``setup.py`` never sets it, so wheels carry the AVX2 4-way kernel that the
    measurement does cover.)

    Best-effort: a driver that cannot report its wiring still produces a valid
    measurement, so a failure here returns nothing rather than failing the
    check.  The counts themselves are what the verdict rests on.

def _measure(driver: Path, key_class: str, workdir: Path) -> Optional[dict[str, int]]:
    """The four :data:`_METRICS` for one *successful* run of the driver, else None.

    The exit-status check is load-bearing, not defensive tidiness.  Callgrind
    prints an ``I refs:`` line for any process it supervises, including one
    that never reached ``main`` — and this tool used to accept that line as a
    measurement.  Handing ``--lib`` a shared object rather than the static
    archive produced exactly that: the driver linked, failed at load with
    ``cannot open shared object file``, and every key class returned the same
    ~109,000 instructions of dynamic-loader work.  All four agreed, so the
    delta was zero, and the gate printed ``PASSED — count is key-independent``
    over a program that had not performed a single cryptographic operation.
    It gave that verdict identically for a build carrying two live
    secret-dependent branches and for one with none.

    ``main`` returns 0 only after every crypto call has succeeded and the
    measured loop has run to completion, so the exit status is a precise
    witness that the thing under measurement actually executed.  No arbitrary
    instruction floor is needed on top of it.

    ``AMA_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOTUNE=1`` is not a convenience, and it fixes two
    separate defects in this instrument.

    On its first call into the dispatch table the library runs the SIMD-vs-
    scalar auto-tune: a best-of-N **wall-clock** benchmark of the Keccak,
    Kyber-NTT and Dilithium-NTT kernels.

    First, it destroys the baseline.  Measured here, the auto-tune costs
    6,950,175,736 retired instructions against the 319,561 the same program
    retires with it off — 21,700x — and because its loop counts are driven by
    a clock it is not reproducible: two runs of one driver on one identical
    input differed by 9 instructions, and eight runs of identical inputs spread
    over 27.  That is a wall-clock measurement smuggled into the baseline of a
    check whose whole premise is that it needs neither statistics nor a quiet
    machine, and on a loaded runner it could consume the per-target threshold
    on its own.  With the auto-tune off the count is bit-identical run to run.

    Second, and worse, it chooses the SUBJECT.  On the host this was measured
    on the auto-tune found the SIMD Keccak slower than the scalar one
    (simd=12,724,814 ns vs generic=1,063,456 ns) and reverted the slot — so the
    gate measured ``keccak_f1600 -> scalar (BMI1/BMI2)`` at 19,416 instructions
    per SHA3-256 call.  With the auto-tune off the same program dispatches
    ``keccak_f1600 -> SIMD`` at 146,748.  Which kernel any given run of this
    gate actually tested was therefore decided by a timing measurement on
    whatever machine happened to run it, and was recorded nowhere.

    Disabling the auto-tune pins the subject to the library's default SIMD
    wiring — a fixed, named target rather than a host-dependent one — and the
    report below prints that wiring so the evidence says what it covers.  This
    is a deliberate narrowing: the scalar fallback is NOT covered by these
    counts and must not be claimed as such; ``AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY`` pins
    individual slots for that, and the scalar AES-GCM invariance job in
    dudect.yml covers that path directly.
