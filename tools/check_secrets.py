AMA Cryptography — In-House Secret Scanner (INVARIANT-23)
=========================================================

Blocks credential material from entering the public repository.

**Why this is written in house.**  A cryptographic library is exactly the
worst case for an off-the-shelf secret scanner: the tree is *full* of
high-entropy hex — NIST KAT vectors, ACVP responses, fuzz seed corpora, an
Ed25519 public key and detached signature in ``_integrity_signature.py`` — all
of which are public by design.  A generic entropy scanner drowns that in false
positives, and the usual response (a blanket ignore file) is what lets a real
key slip through later.  This scanner is written against *this* repository's
layout so the allowlist is narrow, explicit, and justified per entry, and so
the tool carries no third-party supply-chain dependency (consistent with
INVARIANT-1's zero-external-dependency posture).

Detection classes
-----------------
1. **Private key blocks** — PEM/PKCS#8/OpenSSH/PGP private key armour.  These
   are never legitimate in this repository; the signing key is generated at
   build time and discarded (see ``ama_cryptography/_build_sign.py``).
2. **Provider credentials** — AWS access-key ids, GitHub PATs, Slack tokens,
   Google API keys, and generic ``Bearer``/basic-auth blobs.
3. **Assigned secrets** — an assignment to a secret-named identifier
   (``password``, ``api_key``, ``token``, ...) whose value is a high-entropy
   literal.  Placeholder values (``changeme``, ``your_password_here``, ...)
   are recognised and permitted so examples stay readable.
4. **Environment files** — any tracked ``.env``-style file carrying a value.

Exit status
-----------
``0`` when clean, ``1`` when any finding survives the allowlist.  The scanner
is *fail-closed*: an unreadable file or an unknown-but-suspicious pattern is
reported rather than skipped.

Usage
-----
    python tools/check_secrets.py                # scan tracked files
    python tools/check_secrets.py --paths a b    # scan specific paths
    python tools/check_secrets.py --staged       # pre-commit mode

# fixtures past both this scanner and GitHub push protection during

# example here: a comment carrying a credential-shaped string would itself be
# a finding, and suppressing that would reintroduce the very problem.)
