AMA Cryptography — Release Tag Shape Gate (INVARIANT-10)
========================================================

Refuses to release from a tag that is not an **annotated, signed** tag object.

Why this exists
---------------
INVARIANT-10 requires signed commits, and ``release.yml``'s operator runbook
has always said to tag with ``git tag -s``. Nothing checked that it happened,
and the repository's own history is what that gap looks like. Measured against
the eleven tags present when this gate was written::

    v1.0.0   commit   (lightweight — cannot carry a signature at all)
    v1.1     commit   (lightweight)
    v2.0.0   commit   (lightweight)
    v2.1.2   tag      no signature found
    v2.1.5   commit   (lightweight)
    v3.0.0   commit   (lightweight)
    v3.1.0   tag      no signature found
    v3.2.0   tag      no signature found
    v3.3.0   commit   (lightweight)
    v3.4.0   tag      no signature found
    v3.5.0   tag      no signature found

Not one is signed, and six are lightweight — a ref pointing straight at a
commit, with no tag object, therefore no place to put a signature and nothing
to fix after the fact. Every one of those releases went out through a pipeline
whose documentation described a signed tag.

The distinction matters beyond bookkeeping. A lightweight tag is a mutable
pointer: anyone who can push can move it, and the release pipeline will
happily rebuild from wherever it now points. An annotated tag is an object in
the object store with its own hash, and a signature over that object binds the
tag name, the target commit, the tagger and the date together. Only the second
one is evidence.

What is checked, and what deliberately is not
---------------------------------------------
Checked, fail-closed:

1. **The ref resolves.** A release cannot proceed from a tag that is not there.
2. **The ref names a tag object**, not a commit. This is the lightweight case.
3. **The tag object carries a complete signature block** — OpenPGP, SSH, or
   the ``SIGNED MESSAGE`` form ``gpg.format=x509``/gpgsm emits. A matched
   BEGIN/END pair on whole lines, in order; a marker quoted inside the tag
   *message* is prose and does not count. See ``is_signed`` for why that
   distinction is the difference between a gate and a substring search.

**Not** checked, and stated plainly rather than implied (INVARIANT-37): this
tool does **not** verify the signature. What is checked here is *shape*: the
properties that were wrong on all eleven historical tags, that need no key
material to establish, and whose absence means no later verification can ever
succeed. Keeping verification out of this tool is what lets it run first, in
preflight, before anything is built — with no key material, no ``ssh-keygen``
and no network.

Verification is a separate check with a separate input, and it is not missing.
The trust store — the list binding a public key to a name, without which a
valid signature is unattributable — ships at ``.github/allowed_signers``.
``tests/test_release_tag_trust_store.py`` checks on every CI run that the key in
it is the key that signed v4.0.0, and ``README.md`` documents the
``git verify-tag`` invocation a consumer runs offline.

Earlier releases of this docstring said the repository shipped no trust store
"because publishing one would assert a key binding that only the account owner
can establish". The owner had already established it before that sentence was
written; INVARIANT-10's addendum records the correction and why the mistake is
worth keeping on the page.

GitHub's own verified/unverified badge is the complementary half. It is
account-level state, not repository state — it turns on when the signing key
is registered under Settings -> SSH and GPG keys with type **Signing Key** —
so it is reported by ``release.yml`` for the operator to read, not gated here.

The fetch trap this gate would otherwise walk into
--------------------------------------------------
``actions/checkout`` at its default depth, on a tag-push trigger, fetches the
*commit* the tag resolves to and writes a local ``refs/tags/<name>`` pointing
at it. That local ref is lightweight even when the pushed tag is annotated, so
running this check straight after a bare checkout would report a false
lightweight verdict on a correctly signed tag. ``release.yml`` therefore
re-fetches the tag ref explicitly, with ``--force``, before invoking this tool;
see the step comment there. The lightweight failure message below repeats the
warning, because a false red on a release gate is how gates get switched off.

Usage
-----
::

    python tools/check_release_tag.py v4.0.0
    python tools/check_release_tag.py v4.0.0 --repo /path/to/checkout

Exits 0 when the tag is an annotated tag object carrying a signature block,
1 otherwise.

    Raised in review, and the reviewer was right. A tag message is free text;
    an annotated tag whose message quotes ``-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----``
    (a changelog entry about signing, a paste of a failure message, this
    module's own docstring in a tag body) would have satisfied a bare
    substring test while carrying no signature at all. That is a fail-open in
    a gate whose entire job is to fail closed, and the fact that it takes an
    unusual message to trigger is not a defence: the eleven tags this gate was
    written for are proof that unusual is what actually ships.

    Whole-line matching matters as much as the pairing. Armour delimiters
    occupy a line of their own in every format git emits, so a marker quoted
    inline — ``see the -----BEGIN SSH SIGNATURE----- block`` — is prose, and
    only a marker alone on its line is structure. Requiring both, and
    requiring END to follow BEGIN, means the message would have to reproduce
    a whole armour envelope line for line to pass. At that point it is
    indistinguishable from a signature by inspection, which is the honest
    limit of a shape check and is exactly what this module's header says it
