"""Generate the AMA Cryptography C-library CycloneDX SBOM from a single
source of truth.

INVARIANT-11 declares the SBOM as the release gate.  Before this script
existed, ``.github/workflows/security.yml`` shipped the C-library
components as a hardcoded heredoc with ``"version": "3.0.0"`` baked in,
even when ``pyproject.toml`` had bumped to 3.1.0.  Drift on day one.

This generator reads the package version from ``pyproject.toml`` once
and renders every C-library component pinned to that version.  CI then
asserts via ``--check`` that the rendered output matches a committed
copy at ``docs/compliance/sbom-c-library.json``.  Any version-bump PR
that forgets to regenerate the SBOM fails CI before the artefact can
ship to PyPI.

Exit codes:
    0  generated (or, with --check, the on-disk copy matches)
    1  drift detected with --check, OR a structural error

Usage:
    Regenerate:           python tools/generate_sbom.py
    CI assertion:         python tools/generate_sbom.py --check
    Explicit output path: python tools/generate_sbom.py --output PATH

# C-library component manifest

# Each row is (component_name, description) — the version field is driven
# entirely by pyproject.toml at render time so a release bump cannot
# leave a stale `"version": "X.Y.Z"` baked into the artefact.
#
# Keep this list in sync with the C sources under src/c/ that publish a
# named library component to the SBOM consumer: every top-level TU whose
# capability is exposed through the public API (include/ama_cryptography.h)
# is a component; TUs that only support those capabilities belong in
# INTERNAL_SUPPORT below.  The split is enforced — render_sbom() refuses
# to run if a top-level src/c/*.c file is in neither set, so a new
# primitive cannot land without an SBOM decision (the eleven-entry list
# inherited from the old security.yml heredoc silently missed every
# primitive added after it: Ascon, FROST, agent binding, HSS/LMS, the
# NIST prime curves — closed out in the 3.5.0 release).  A PR that edits
# this list must also update the standards-alignment table in
# ``docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md``.  Order is alphabetical so
# a diff between two SBOM revisions is easy to read.
