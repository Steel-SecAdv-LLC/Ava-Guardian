AMA Cryptography — Vendor Isolation Gate (INVARIANT-1, enforced five ways)

INVARIANT-1 says no third-party cryptographic implementation may be linked,
imported or called by the shipped library.  Until this script existed, that
claim rested on:

* ``tools/check_corpus_originality.py``, which AST-scans for *subprocess*
  invocations of external crypto binaries (``openssl``, ``gpg``, …); and
* comments, naming, documentation and intent.

Nothing checked the four things that actually decide the question:

``linkage``
    What the built shared object *depends on*, what symbols it expects an
    external library to supply, and what symbols it defines itself.  The
    third is what a *static* link leaves behind: it produces no dependency
    record and imports nothing, so the first two see a clean library while
    vendor code runs inside it.

``build configuration``
    A ``find_package(OpenSSL)`` added to CMakeLists.txt, or a ``-lcrypto``
    inherited from a toolchain file, is the shortest path from "no vendor" to
    "vendor executing inside the library" — and if the link is static and the
    build hides its symbols, the artefact carries no trace of it.  The build
    files are where that decision is written down, so that is where it is
    checked.

``runtime``
    What is actually resident in ``sys.modules`` after ``import
    ama_cryptography``.  Source scanning misses transitive imports: a module
    AMA imports for an unrelated reason that itself imports ``cryptography``
    puts an OpenSSL binding in the process, and no ``import`` statement in
    this repository names it.

``the C tree``
    Whether any ``#include <openssl/...>`` (or another forbidden vendor's
    header) exists under ``src/c`` at all, and whether the directory the
    vendored Ed25519 backend once lived in, ``src/c/vendor/``, has come back.
    Until 2026-09 that vendored tree carried an OpenSSL SHA-512 and an OpenSSL
    ``RAND_bytes`` as the ``#else`` arm of its hash and RNG selection, kept
    out of the build by two macro definitions in one shim file that nothing
    verified; the tree is gone and the rule is now absolute.

``the comparator boundary``
    ``benchmarks/`` is explicitly authorised to invoke peer implementations —
    that is what a comparative benchmark *is* — and ``benchmarks/requirements-
    bench.txt`` pins them.  Authorisation for benchmarking is not
    authorisation for anything else, and the only thing keeping the
    comparators on their side of the line was that no package module happened
    to import ``benchmarks``.

All five are checked here, and the binary formats are parsed in-tree with
``struct`` rather than by shelling out to ``readelf`` / ``otool`` /
``dumpbin``: this gate must run on every platform the wheels are built on,
including runners where those tools are absent, and a gate that silently
skips is the failure mode this repository's audit exists to remove.

Parsing them in-tree carries its own obligation, which the first version of
this file did not meet: the parser has to accept what the platform actually
ships.  macOS wheels are ``universal2``, so the artefact there is a *fat*
wrapper around two Mach-O images and not a Mach-O image at all.  The parser
recognised only thin images, so on macOS it reported "unrecognised binary
format" — fail-closed, and therefore not a false clean, but the linkage
check could not examine the shipped artefact on that platform at all.  Every
slice of a universal binary is now parsed and the results are **unioned**: a
vendor present in one architecture is a vendor in the shipped artefact, and
reading only the host's slice would be an evasion path.

Forbidden vendors
-----------------
OpenSSL, libsodium, wolfSSL, Botan, Nettle, libgcrypt and mbedTLS may not
supply any internal cryptographic operation, primitive, helper, fallback or
processing step.  They are authorised **only** as explicitly isolated
benchmark comparators under ``benchmarks/``, and may not become required for
a normal build or for any non-benchmark execution path.

Checks
------
``--source ama_cryptography``
    No module under the package may import a forbidden vendor binding, and
    none may import ``benchmarks`` (which would drag the comparators into the
    package's own import graph).  Also flags a ``ctypes`` load whose library
    name is a forbidden vendor, which no ``import`` statement would reveal.

``--build-config``
    No ``CMakeLists.txt``, ``cmake/**.cmake`` or ``setup.py`` outside
    ``benchmarks/`` may search for, find, or link a forbidden vendor.
    Commands are matched, not words: ``CMakeLists.txt`` names OpenSSL in a
    status message and in the comment recording why it is deliberately not
    probed, and a scan that cannot tell a mention from a link would fire on
    the documentation of the boundary it is enforcing.

``--runtime``
    Imports the package in a clean subprocess and fails if any forbidden
    top-level module is resident afterwards.

``--library PATH``
    Parses the native library's own linkage records — ELF ``DT_NEEDED`` plus
    ``.dynsym``, Mach-O ``LC_LOAD_DYLIB`` plus ``LC_SYMTAB`` (thin or
    universal), PE import directory — and fails on a forbidden vendor name
    or symbol prefix, whether the symbol is imported (dynamic link) or
    defined by the image itself (static link).

With no check selected, every check that can run in the current environment
runs.  ``--library`` is skipped only when no path is given; a path that is
given and cannot be parsed is an error, never a skip.

Exit codes
----------
``0``  every selected check passed
``1``  a violation was found, or a requested check could not be performed
``2``  usage error

#
# The Python source check below scans the package.  The C tree needs its own
# rule, because a `#include <openssl/...>` is a vendor performing an internal
# operation whether or not anything links it deliberately.
#
# History matters here.  Until 2026-09 the tree carried a vendored copy of
# a public-domain Ed25519 implementation under `src/c/vendor/`, whose hash
# and RNG selection fell back
# to OpenSSL in their `#else` arms; the check then had to know which vendored
# files legitimately named OpenSSL and which macros the shim defined to keep
# those arms out of the build — two lines in one file standing between the
# shipped library and OpenSSL doing its Ed25519 hashing.  The vendored tree
# is gone: every Ed25519 operation runs on the in-house arithmetic in
# `src/c/ama_ed25519.c` and `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_ge.h`, and
# INVARIANT-1's vendoring addendum now says there is nothing to vendor.
#
# So the rule is absolute rather than inventoried: `src/c/vendor/` must not
# exist, and no file under `src/c/` may include a forbidden vendor header at
# all.  A future vendoring would have to reintroduce the directory AND
# rewrite this check, in the open, with an INVARIANT-1 amendment to match.
