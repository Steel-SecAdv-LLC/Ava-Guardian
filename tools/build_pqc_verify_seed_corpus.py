AMA Cryptography — seeds for the fully-fuzzed verify cases of the PQC
signature harnesses (``fuzz_dilithium``, ``fuzz_sphincs``).

Why this exists
---------------
Both harnesses carry a case that hands ``ama_dilithium_verify`` /
``ama_sphincs_verify`` a signature and a public key made entirely of
attacker-supplied bytes.  Neither had ever executed:

* ``fuzz_dilithium`` case 1 needs ``payload_len >= 3,309 + 1,952 = 5,261``,
  so 5,262 bytes of input.  The largest seed in its corpus was 56 bytes.
* ``fuzz_sphincs`` case 1 needs ``49,856 + 64 = 49,920`` and case 2 needs
  ``49,856``.  The largest seed in its corpus was 36 bytes.

and the lane ran with ``-max_len=4096``, which libFuzzer applies to corpus
units as well as to mutations — a 60,001-byte seed enters the in-memory
corpus at 4,096 bytes, measured on this tree.  So the branches were
unreachable by construction, not merely improbable.
``tools/check_fuzz_input_reachability.py`` now derives each lane's ceiling
from the harness and fails if a branch sits above it; these seeds are what
make the branch execute on the first pass rather than after the mutator
happens to reach the exact length.

What the seeds cover, and why these
-----------------------------------
The verify path's work is parsing: a signature is unpacked into its hint,
challenge and response components, and a public key into ``rho`` and ``t1``
(ML-DSA), or a hypertree of Merkle authentication paths and WOTS+ chains
(SLH-DSA).  What separates inputs is therefore the byte VALUES at fixed
offsets, not the length — the length is fixed by the guard.  So each target
gets the exact length with three contents:

* all-zero — every packed field at the bottom of its range, and for ML-DSA
  the hint-count byte at 0, which is the "no hints" degenerate parse;
* all-0xFF — every field at the top, and for ML-DSA a hint count far above
  ``OMEGA``, which the unpacker must reject rather than walk;
* pseudorandom — a mid-range parse that lands neither extreme,

plus one seed a single byte SHORT of the guard, which must take the
``break`` and is the cheapest regression test that the guard still guards.

A trailing message is appended to the exact-length seeds so ``msg_len`` is
non-zero on the branch; the harness computes it as the remainder.  The one
exception is ``fuzz_sphincs`` case 2 (fuzzed signature against the cached
public key), which verifies a fixed literal message — its seeds are the
exact signature length with no tail.

Determinism
-----------
Every byte is a fixed function of the seed's name, so re-running this script
reproduces the corpus byte-for-byte.  ``--check`` verifies the committed
files match, so drift between the generator and the corpus fails loudly.
