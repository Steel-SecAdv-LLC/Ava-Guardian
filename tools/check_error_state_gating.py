AMA Cryptography — FIPS 140-3 §4.9.2 Error-State Gating Check
=============================================================

Asserts that every public entry point in ``ama_cryptography/pqc_backends.py``
which reaches the native library refuses to run while the module is in the
FIPS error state.

Why
---
FIPS 140-3 §4.9.2 requires a module whose power-on self-tests have failed to
enter an error state in which *all* cryptographic output is inhibited.  For
most of this library's life that requirement was satisfied only by
``crypto_api``, which calls ``check_operational()`` on its public methods.
``pqc_backends`` — the layer that actually performs key generation, signing,
KEM encapsulation, AEAD, HMAC and KDF — called straight through to the C
library with no state check at all.  Eighty public functions, none of them
gated.  A module that had logged ``FIPS 140-3 POST FAILURE`` at import went on
signing and generating keys for any caller that reached past ``crypto_api``,
which is exactly what every one of this project's own internal modules does.
The error state inhibited nothing that mattered.

The fix is one call to ``check_crypto_permitted()`` at the top of each such
function.  That fix is one line, which is precisely why it needs a machine to
enforce it: the next primitive added to this module will be written by
someone who has never read this file, and a convention that depends on memory
is a convention that decays.  A gap here is silent — the function works, the
tests pass, and the only symptom is a FIPS violation that appears solely on
the failure path nobody exercises.

What this checks
----------------
Every module-level ``def`` in ``pqc_backends.py`` that

  * has a public name (no leading underscore), and
  * calls a native symbol

must call ``check_crypto_permitted()`` **before** the first such call.

Both halves of that sentence were once weaker than they read.

*Ordering.*  The Python audit asked only whether a guard appeared anywhere in
the body, while ``audit_pyx`` — the same gate over the ``.pyx`` bindings — had
always rejected a guard placed after a native call.  Two halves of one gate
enforcing different rules is the kind of gap that survives review, and the
weaker half was guarding the larger surface.  A guard reached after the C
kernel has run does not inhibit anything: the output exists.  FIPS 140-3
§4.9.2 is about not producing it.

*Reachability.*  A native symbol resolved and called in one expression
(``getattr(_native_lib, name)(...)``) was matched; the same call split across
two statements was not, because the binding is not a call and the call is of a
plain local name.  A function written that way reached the C kernel while the
gate recorded it as making no native call — and a function that makes no
native call is never asked for a guard.  Local names bound to a native symbol
are now tracked and calls through them counted.

A third variant of the same class — a symbol *selected* between two native
references, ``fn = _native_lib.ama_a if cond else _native_lib.ama_b`` — did
appear in the current tree, and had since 2026-07-28: ``native_nistp_ecdsa_verify``
in ``pqc_backends.py``, a public module-level entry point in the one module
this gate audits.  It was invisible for the same reason as the split binding,
so the audit skipped the function entirely and its guard was unenforced;
deleting that guard left the tool's output unchanged.  Conditional and
annotated bindings are now tracked too, and the entry-point count went from
85 to 86.

An earlier revision of this docstring asserted that neither shape appeared in
the tree.  That was true of the two shapes it described and false of the class
they belong to, which is the more useful thing for a reader to know: the
lesson is that a gate matching a fixed list of syntactic shapes is only as
complete as that list, so the matcher now recurses through the forms that
*are* the resulting callable rather than enumerating spellings.  It
deliberately does not walk the whole expression: ``x = wrapper(_native_lib.ama_y)``
does not bind ``x`` to the native symbol, and a gate that demands a guard
there would fire on correct code.

Deliberate exemptions live in ``EXEMPT`` below, each with a stated reason.
The exemption list is itself checked: an entry naming a function that no
longer exists is an error, so the list cannot rot into a silent allowlist.

Which modules are scanned
-------------------------
``MODULES`` was hand-maintained, which meant a new module reaching the native
library was unaudited *by default* rather than by decision (audit M16).  A
discovery step now AST-scans ``ama_cryptography/**/*.py`` for the forms that
reach the library — ``_native_lib`` as a Name/Attribute, ``getattr(x,
"_native_lib", …)``, or a ``_cy_*`` call — and requires every module it finds
to appear in ``MODULES`` (audited) or in ``EXEMPT_MODULES`` (exempted with a
reason for why the body-level AST audit is not its enforcement — indirect
reach through a private helper, a presence check, or delegation to
``pqc_backends``' gated wrappers).  A native-reaching module in neither list
fails the check.  ``EXEMPT_MODULES`` is staleness-checked the same way
``EXEMPT`` is: an entry that no longer reaches the library is an error.

Usage
-----
    python tools/check_error_state_gating.py

Exit status: 0 when every public native entry point is gated, 1 otherwise.

#: library.
#:
#: ``ascon`` is here now, and the reason it was not is worth recording because
#: it was a wrong reason rather than a missing one.  The note that stood here
#: said ``ascon`` reaches native "only INDIRECTLY through a private helper
#: (``_require_native``) … because a body-level scan cannot see the reach".
#: The reach was never the problem: ``ascon.hash256`` and the two AEAD entry
#: points each call ``lib.ama_ascon_*(...)`` in their own bodies, and
#: ``_native_call_lines`` is receiver-agnostic, so the scan saw every one of
#: them.  What it could not see was the GUARD, which sits inside
#: ``_require_native``.  :func:`guard_delegating_helpers` now follows exactly
#: one level of that indirection — a private function whose FIRST executable
#: statement is a guard call — so the module can be enforced statically
#: instead of being excluded on a premise that did not hold.
#:
#: ``hybrid_combiner`` stays out, and for that one the original note IS
#: accurate: it reaches native through ``_hkdf_native``, which is where both
#: the guard and the native call live, so the public functions' bodies contain

    ``_native_call_lines`` matches ``getattr(_native_lib, name)(...)`` — the
    symbol resolved and called in one expression.  Split across two statements
    the same call disappeared from the scan::

        fn = getattr(_native_lib, name)   # binding, not a call
        fn(a, b)                          # call of a plain local name

    Neither line matches on its own, so a function using this shape reached
    the C kernel while the gate reported it as making no native call at all —
    and a function that makes no native call is never required to carry a
    guard.  No current code uses the shape; the point is that nothing stopped
    it, and the two-line form is the natural way to write a loop that resolves
    a symbol once and calls it repeatedly.

    Both routes to a bare symbol are collected: ``getattr(_native_lib, ...)``
    and direct attribute access ``_native_lib.ama_x`` (as a value, not a call).

    A symbol *selected* between two such references counts too.  Matching only
    the two flat shapes above missed::

        fn = _native_lib.ama_nistp_ecdsa_verify_raw_ex if raw else \\
             _native_lib.ama_nistp_ecdsa_verify_ex
        rc = int(fn(...))

    which is an ``ast.IfExp``, not an ``Attribute``.  That shape is not
    hypothetical and is not new: ``native_nistp_ecdsa_verify`` in
    ``pqc_backends.py`` — a public module-level entry point, in the one module
    this gate audits — has used it since 2026-07-28, predating the
    alias-tracking commit whose docstring said "Neither shape appears in the
    current tree".  Measured before this fix: ``_native_call_lines`` returned
    ``[]`` and ``_calls_native`` returned ``False`` for that function, so
    ``audit()`` skipped it at the "no native lines" guard and never asked
    whether it was gated.  Deleting its ``check_crypto_permitted()`` from a
    copy of the module left the audit's output completely unchanged.  The
    function *is* correctly guarded today; the defect was that the gate had
    silently stopped enforcing it, which is precisely the regression this
    module exists to prevent.

    The recursion is deliberately narrow — ``IfExp`` branches and ``BoolOp``
    operands, both of which *are* the resulting callable — rather than a walk
    of the whole expression.  A blanket walk would also match
    ``x = wrapper(_native_lib.ama_y)``, where ``x`` is not the native symbol,
    and would then demand a guard on functions that make no native call: a
    gate that fires on correct code teaches people to bypass it.
