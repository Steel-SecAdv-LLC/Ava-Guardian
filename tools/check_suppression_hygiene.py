# Suppression tokens to scan for.
#
# ``nosemgrep`` is included here because INVARIANT-13 is worded "any
# equivalent suppression marker"; semgrep is part of the same defence-in-
# depth stack as bandit/ruff/mypy and the same tracking-ID + justification
# requirements apply.  Devin reviews #19/#20/#21/#22 (PR #277) caught four
# ``nosemgrep`` markers that lacked tracking IDs; extending the scanner is
# the regression check that would have caught those at PR-review time.
#
# Two-stage matching:
#   1. ``_SUPPRESSION_RE`` matches *any* suppression marker — including a
#      bare ``# nosemgrep`` with no rule id — so the line is always
#      flagged for the tracking-ID + justification pass.
#   2. For the ``nosemgrep`` family specifically, ``_NOSEMGREP_STRICT_RE``
#      then asserts the line-targeted form ``# nosemgrep: <rule_id>``
#      (Copilot review @ tools/check_suppression_hygiene.py:34).  Bare
#      ``# nosemgrep`` blanket-suppresses every rule on the line, which
#      is exactly the kind of catch-all the INVARIANT-13 audit trail is
#      meant to prevent.  Semgrep itself accepts both forms; this repo
#      requires the colon + rule id form so reviewers can verify *which*
#      rule each suppression silences.

#: on its own prose is exactly what guaranteed the file-scoped forms were never

# The same requirement, for the two other markers that blanket-suppress a whole
# scanner when written bare.  Adding them is not symmetry for its own sake:
#
# ``nosec``  bandit resolves ``# nosec <text>`` by parsing <text> as test ids
#            (``NOSEC_COMMENT`` / ``NOSEC_COMMENT_TESTS`` in bandit's manager),
#            warns "Test in comment: X is not a test name or id, ignoring" for
#            every word it cannot resolve, and — this is the part that matters —
#            treats an EMPTY resolved set as "no specific tests", i.e. blanket.
#            So this repository's house style, ``# nosec -- reason (TAG-NNN)``,
#            would read to a reviewer as a targeted suppression carrying its
#            justification while silencing every bandit test on the line.  A
#            ``B``-code makes the resolved set non-empty and the marker means
#            what it looks like.  Verified against bandit 1.9.2.
#
# ``noqa``   ruff (and flake8) treat a bare ``noqa`` comment as "all rules on
#            this line"; only the ``noqa: <CODE>`` form targets one.  Same
#            catch-all, same audit-trail problem.  (The marker is spelled here
#            without its leading hash: ruff scans comment PROSE for the
#            hash-prefixed form too, and reports the examples themselves as
#            malformed directives — three warnings in every CI lint log.)
#
# ``type: ignore`` and ``pylint: disable`` are deliberately NOT held to this,
# and the reason is stated rather than left as an omission: mypy's file-level
# ``# type: ignore`` on line 1 is a legitimate bare form that
# ``effective_suppressions`` keeps in scope on purpose, and mypy --strict's
# ``warn_unused_ignores`` already reports an ignore that suppresses nothing.
# Neither family has a bare occurrence in the tree today.

    raw line, which put every string literal on such a line back in scope — the
    exact thing tokenizing was supposed to rule out. The comment token's own
    text is used here instead.

    **Trailing comments only.** ``bandit``, ``ruff`` and ``mypy`` all anchor a
    suppression to the line of the finding, so a full-line comment suppresses
    nothing; it is prose. That distinction never mattered while the scan
    covered only ``ama_cryptography/`` and ``tests/``, where nothing discusses
    markers in a comment. It matters immediately in ``tools/``, where the
    checkers *document their own subject matter*: eight comments explaining
    what a ``# nosec`` is were reported as unjustified suppressions the moment
    that tree was included. A gate that fires on its own documentation is one
    people learn to route around.

    The standalone forms that are REAL — the file-scoped directives
    ``_FILE_SCOPED_RE`` matches — are kept in scope explicitly rather than lost

# resolves to `Any` through `ignore_missing_imports`, `name = None` is fine,
# and the same ignore is an ERROR under `warn_unused_ignores`.
#
# So the marker makes the file green in one place and red in the other, which
# is the "green local mypy --strict reached a red CI" failure the type-check
# step already warns about.  It appeared four times in this tree
# (`setup.py` twice, `benchmarks/benchmark_suite.py`,
# `examples/python/complete_demo.py`), each a latent CI break.
#
# The fix is never another suppression: DECLARE the name before the `try`
# (`np: Any`) and import under an alias, which makes the verdict the same in
# both environments.
