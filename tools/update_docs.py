AMA Cryptography — Global Auto-Documentation System
=====================================================

Updates documentation targets from source-of-truth data:
  1. CHANGELOG.md   — new section from git log since last entry
  2. README.md       — refresh version number and date stamps
  3. Benchmark docs  — regenerate tables from ``benchmarks/benchmark-results.json``
                       (canonical-host run; the actual measurement output),
                       cross-checked against ``benchmarks/baseline.json``
                       for the regression-floor secondary column. Pre-3.0.1
                       this generator pointed at ``baseline.json`` and so
                       published the *floors* as if they were headline
                       numbers — the wiki caption reflected that, calling the
                       table "Regression Baselines". The published numbers now
                       match what the suite actually measures on the canonical
                       host; the floor remains visible as a secondary column
                       so reviewers see both the headline and the CI safety
                       net. Since 5.0.0 the floor is a measured median on the
                       runner class named in ``metadata.runner_cpu_class``,
                       not a fraction of the headline, so the two columns are
                       different hosts and the floor may legitimately exceed
                       the measured figure.
  4. wiki/*.md       — update version and date stamps

Usage:
    python tools/update_docs.py                # full update
    python tools/update_docs.py --dry-run      # preview only
    python tools/update_docs.py --changelog-only

Text I/O
--------
Every read and write below passes ``encoding="utf-8"`` explicitly, and every
write also passes ``newline=""``.  Neither is decoration.

``Path.read_text()`` without an encoding uses the *locale* encoding, which on
Windows is the ANSI code page (cp1252 on a US/Western install).  ``CHANGELOG
.md`` is UTF-8 and full of em dashes, Greek letters and mathematical symbols,
so the read raised ``UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte
0x90`` on every Windows job — the doc-sync tool could not run at all on a
platform this project tests across five Python versions.

The write side was worse than an error, because it would have succeeded on the
subset that round-trips: ``write_text`` in text mode translates ``"\\n"`` to
``"\\r\\n"`` on Windows, so a single run would have rewritten every line ending
in ``CHANGELOG.md`` and ``README.md``.  ``tools/check_line_endings.py`` exists
precisely to reject that, so the tool that maintains the documentation would
have failed the repository's own gate on the documentation it maintains.
``newline=""`` disables the translation and pins LF on every platform, the
same way ``ama_cryptography/_build_sign.py`` pins the signature artefact.

#     benchmarks/benchmark-results.json`` (the same command CI runs — see

#     step, which also flows ``benchmarks/benchmark-results.json`` and
#     ``benchmark-report.md`` through to the workflow artifacts).
#   * The regression floor stays in baseline.json and is shown in a
#     secondary column.  Since 5.0.0 it is NOT a discount of the headline
#     number: it is a measured median on the CI runner class named in
#     `metadata.runner_cpu_class` (x86-64 slow-class median with a uniform
#     45% tolerance; aarch64 homogeneous, 15%/25%).  The two columns are
#     therefore different hosts, and a floor ABOVE a measured figure is an
#     ordinary result — in wiki/Performance-Benchmarks.md it is the case on

# regression floor from ``benchmarks/baseline.json``.  Reviewers see both:
#   * "Throughput (ops/sec)" — what the host actually measured.
#   * "Regression floor"     — what CI enforces (deliberately ~65% of
#                              measured, with `tolerance_percent` headroom).
#
# Headline === canonical-host run.  The pre-3.0.1 generator pointed at the
# floor file and so unintentionally published the safety-net numbers as if
# they were the canonical figures; that has been corrected here.

    Both the ``benchmarks`` and ``pqc_benchmarks`` blocks contribute.
    On a name collision the **PQC block wins**, mirroring the runner's
    own resolution order: ``benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py`` reads each
    benchmark's config from whichever block holds the matching key, and
    PQC functions (e.g. ``x25519_scalarmult``) are registered in
    ``pqc_benchmark_functions`` so the runner pulls their config from
    ``pqc_benchmarks``.  Mirroring that here ensures
    ``tools/update_docs.py`` and ``benchmark_runner.py`` agree on the
    canonical floor for every primitive.

    Devin review #10 caught a 3.0.0-audit-PR regression where a new
    ``x25519_scalarmult`` entry was added to the ``benchmarks`` block
    while the existing one in ``pqc_benchmarks`` was left at a stale
    floor (5,000 ops/sec, ~38 % of measured) — the runner kept reading
    the stale ``pqc_benchmarks`` entry and the new ``benchmarks`` entry
    was dead.  That has been fixed (the ``benchmarks`` entry was
    removed and the ``pqc_benchmarks`` entry re-floored to the
    measured 13,000 ops/sec).  This implementation tolerates a future
    ``benchmarks`` ⇄ ``pqc_benchmarks`` overlap by deterministically
    deferring to the PQC block; the existing CI lint check
    ``benchmarks/check_baseline_justification.py`` (run by
    ``.github/workflows/baseline-guard.yml``) catches baseline-floor
    regressions at PR review time, complementing this resolution
    contract.
