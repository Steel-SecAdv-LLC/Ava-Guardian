Verify that the AMA Cryptography version string matches in every file that
declares it.  Run as part of CI to block releases where one version was
bumped without the others (audit 5a).

The canonical source is ``ama_cryptography/__init__.py``'s ``__version__``.
Every other occurrence must match literally (no range operators, etc.).

Also verifies that ``.github/INVARIANTS.md`` stays a short pointer to the
canonical root ``INVARIANTS.md``.  The root copy is the only canonical
document; CI fails if the pointer grows into a divergent duplicate.

Additionally enforces that no C source file under ``src/c/**/*.{c,h}``
embeds a hardcoded ``"X.Y.Z"`` version-string literal near a
``VERSION`` / ``version`` / ``Version`` identifier. The canonical
location for the C-side version is ``include/ama_cryptography.h``'s
``AMA_CRYPTOGRAPHY_VERSION_STRING`` macro (which the canonical-anchor
checks above already pin to the package version). The
``src/c/`` tree should *use* that macro, never re-declare a literal —
today the scan returns zero hits and that is the steady state. The
test (``tests/test_version_consistency.py``) writes a
synthetic C file with a fake version literal into a temp tree and
asserts the scanner flags it.

Exit code:
    0  all versions and invariants agree, no embedded C-source version literals
    1  a mismatch or stray C-source version literal was detected

# The Python layer mirrors integer constants that are *defined* in

# policy selectors. Each one is a second declaration of a value the C header
# owns, which is the same duplication this script exists to police — a version
# string is simply the one everybody notices when it drifts.
#
# Nothing checked these. `AMA_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM = -1` was transcribed into
# `pqc_backends.py` with no gate at all, and the same value appears again in
# `agent_binding.py`. Drift here is worse than a stale version badge: a Python
# module comparing a return code against the wrong number silently stops
# detecting the failure it was written to detect, and every test that exercises
# only the success path still passes.
#
# Matching is mechanical rather than curated so a *new* mirror is covered the
# day it is written: a module-level or class-level `NAME = <int>` in
# ama_cryptography/ is checked whenever `NAME` (leading underscores stripped),
# or `AMA_` + that name, is a constant the header defines. Names that do not
# correspond to anything in the header are ignored — a Python-only constant is
# not a transcription — except where C_CONSTANT_ALIASES says otherwise.

# Deliberate name changes across the boundary. The header spells Ascon's sizes
# `..._LEN` and prefixes them with the subsystem; the Python module drops the
# prefix and says `..._BYTES`, matching its sibling modules. Mechanically
# unrelatable, genuinely the same constant, and therefore worth pinning by hand
