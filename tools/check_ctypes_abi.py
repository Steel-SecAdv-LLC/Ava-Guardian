AMA Cryptography — ctypes ABI Contract Verifier
===============================================

Cross-checks every ctypes signature the Python package assigns against the
prototype the public C header declares for the same symbol.

Why this exists
---------------
A ctypes symbol probe (``hasattr(lib, "ama_foo")``) proves a *name* is
exported.  It says nothing about arity or ABI: ``lib.ama_foo.argtypes = [...]``
succeeds against a symbol of any actual signature, and the first call through
a wrong declaration corrupts the stack or reads foreign memory — silently on
the happy path, exploitably on a crafted one.  The 2026-08 audit flagged
exactly this (finding #7): "ctypes symbol probes verify only that a name is
exported, not its arity/ABI".

A shared object carries no parameter metadata, so the ABI cannot be read from
the artefact.  What the repository *does* carry is the authoritative contract:
``include/ama_cryptography.h``, the header the library is compiled from.  This
gate parses every ``AMA_API`` prototype out of that header and every
``argtypes``/``restype`` assignment out of the Python sources, and requires
them to agree on

* **arity** — the number of parameters, and
* **shape** — a coarse class per position: pointer-like vs. integer-like, and
  pointer/integer/void for the return.

The coarse classes are deliberate.  ``uint8_t*`` vs ``const char*`` is a
distinction ctypes erases anyway (both marshal as a pointer); ``size_t`` vs
``ama_algorithm_t`` are both integers of register width or narrower.  What the
classes DO catch is every drift that corrupts a call frame: an added or
removed parameter, a pointer where an integer is expected (or vice versa), a
void return read as a value.  Those are the ABI bugs a bare name-probe cannot
see, and each one now fails CI instead of shipping.

The runtime counterpart of this static gate is the load-time version
handshake in ``pqc_backends`` (``ama_version_number`` must report the same
major version as the package), which rejects an artefact compiled from a
DIFFERENT header before any of the signatures checked here are configured
against it.

Scope
-----
Every module under ``ama_cryptography/`` that assigns ``argtypes`` or
``restype`` — discovered by walking the package's ASTs, not from a
hand-maintained list.  In practice that is ``pqc_backends.py`` (the primary
native surface, ~110 symbols) plus ``ascon.py``, ``agent_binding.py``,
``secure_memory.py``, ``hybrid_combiner.py``, ``_build_sign.py`` and
``_self_test.py``.

The list *was* hand-maintained, and had drifted: the last three above were
missing from it, so INVARIANT-42 did not cover them.  That is the predictable
end state for a list of files-that-use-a-feature, because adding the feature
to a new file is not a change to the list, and nothing fails when the two
disagree.  ``REQUIRED_MODULES`` now acts as a floor beneath discovery so an
extractor bug cannot quietly empty the scope and report a pass.

Completeness is enforced in both directions inside that scope: a symbol
*called* on a library handle without a signature assignment is an error, and a
signature assigned for a symbol the header does not declare is an error.

Usage
-----
::

    python tools/check_ctypes_abi.py

Exit status: 0 when every assigned signature matches its header prototype and
every called symbol is covered; 1 otherwise.
