INVARIANT-37 — a verification API must not claim a check it does not perform.

Why this exists
---------------
AMA implements the RFC 3161 wire format and the §2.4.2 message-imprint binding.
It does not verify the TSA's CMS ``SignerInfo`` signature and does not validate
the TSA's certificate chain. Neither is implemented anywhere in the library.

By the time anyone checked, the repository asserted the opposite in more than
fifty places. ``ARCHITECTURE.md``'s verification flow listed "Verify TSA
signature and time bounds" as a step. ``THREAT_MODEL.md`` recorded "RFC 3161
TSA with independent verification" as **IMPLEMENTED** — the row an auditor
reads to conclude the threat is mitigated. ``AMA_CRYPTOGRAPHY_ETHICAL_PILLARS.md``
carried a "Mathematical Proof" whose security statement was exactly inverted:
"Requires TSA private key compromise to forge", when forging a token AMA
accepts requires no key at all. A comparison table scored AMA ✓ and OpenSSL ✗
on RFC 3161, on the one axis where OpenSSL does the work and AMA does not. The
module's own docstring opened with "Third-party attestation: Independent
verification by TSA".

None of that was written dishonestly. It was written by people who knew what a
timestamp is *for*, describing a feature named after the thing it does not do.
That is the failure mode this invariant addresses: not lying, but the absence
of anything that would notice.

Why the checker is driven by a capability table
-----------------------------------------------
The obvious implementation is a denylist of forbidden phrases. It would be
wrong in a specific and expensive way: it freezes today's limitation into CI.
The day somebody implements CMS ``SignerInfo`` verification, a phrase denylist
starts rejecting claims that have become *true*, and the fix is to remember to
edit a gate — which is the same class of memory this invariant exists because
nobody had.

So the forbidden claims are derived, not listed.
``ama_cryptography.rfc3161_timestamp.RFC3161_CAPABILITIES`` states which checks
the library performs. This checker reads that table and forbids a claim
**because its capability is ``False``**. Implementing a check and flipping its
entry to ``True`` permits the corresponding claims in the same commit, with no
gate edit and no stale prohibition left behind. The table is also what
:class:`~ama_cryptography.rfc3161_timestamp.TokenVerification` reports and what
``tests/test_rfc3161_api_honesty.py`` drives behaviourally, so the code, the
runtime record, the tests and the documentation cannot disagree in any
direction.

The table is read from the source with ``ast`` rather than by importing the
module, so the gate runs in a lint job with nothing built and no native backend
present. ``tests/test_verification_claim_honesty_gate.py`` asserts the parsed
table equals the imported one, so the two readings cannot drift.

What is checked
---------------
1. **No claim of an unperformed check.** For every capability that is ``False``,
   the claim patterns bound to it must not appear in shipped code or
   documentation *unless negated on the same line*. Same line, deliberately: a
   disclaimer three paragraphs from the claim is how this repository came to
   assert attestation in fifty places while the module docstring disclaimed it.
2. **The misnamed result key is not taught.** No document or docstring may show
   ``results["rfc3161"]``. That key is retained in code for compatibility and
   now warns when read, but a copy-pasteable example teaching it defeats the
   rename that made it honest.
3. **A refusing argument is documented as refusing.** Any parameter named
   ``certificate_file`` or ``tsa_cert_path`` — arguments that request checks AMA
   does not implement, and therefore raise — must be described as refused in its
   function's docstring. The behavioural half (that it really does raise) is
   asserted by the test suite, which can call the functions.
4. **No instruction to install a removed third-party cryptographic library.**
   ``rfc3161ng`` was removed under INVARIANT-1. Documentation telling an
   operator to install it re-creates the dependency the invariant forbids.
5. **The table cannot outgrow its enforcement.** Every ``False`` capability must
   have claim patterns bound to it, and every pattern must name a real
   capability. Adding a capability without teaching the gate what claims it
   governs is a failure, not a silent no-op.

What is deliberately *not* checked
----------------------------------
* Claims about anything other than RFC 3161. Ed25519, ML-DSA, ML-KEM, HMAC,
  SPHINCS+, Argon2id, HKDF and the C primitives are implemented as described.
* This file, and ``tests/test_verification_claim_honesty_gate.py``. Both must
  state the forbidden claims — one to forbid them, the other to require that
  they are rejected. That reason cannot be extended to a third file, and check
  5 fails if the exemption list ever grows.
