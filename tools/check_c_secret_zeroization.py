"""INVARIANT-6 gate: no bare ``memset(SECRET, 0, LEN)`` in the C sources.

Why this exists as a tool rather than a semgrep rule
----------------------------------------------------
``.semgrep.yml`` carries ``bare-memset-zero-secret-named-buffer`` at ERROR
severity, scoped to ``src/c/**``, and both ``tools/check_semgrep_severity.py``
and the CI step name it as one of the blocking rules.  It never ran.  Every
semgrep invocation in this repository scans ``ama_cryptography/`` only, so a
rule restricted to ``src/c/**`` matched nothing and could not fail the gate —
an ERROR-severity control that was, in practice, decorative.

Adding ``src/c/`` to the scan target does not fix it either: semgrep's C parser
does not know this codebase's ``AMA_API`` export macro and reports a syntax
error on every function declared with it (15 files on the current tree).  The
severity gate fails closed on scan errors — correctly — so widening the scope
turns a silent no-op into a permanently red gate.

So the check is implemented here instead, against the same rule, in a parser
that understands the codebase.  The semgrep rule is retained for the Python
tree's benefit and annotated to point here.

What is flagged
---------------
``memset(DST, 0, ...)`` — and the ``0x00`` / ``'\\0'`` spellings — where DST
names secret state.  The name test is deliberately the narrow one the semgrep
rule established: unambiguous prefixes (``secret_``, ``private_``, ``master_``,
``seed_``, ``key_``, ``sk_``, ``priv_``, ``kp_``), unambiguous suffixes
(``_key``, ``_secret``, ``_seed``, ``_state``, ``_priv``, ``_kp``, ``_sk``,
``_ks``), and a short list of known-secret spellings (``round_keys``,
``tag_mask``, ``ipad``/``opad``, ``h_table``, …).  Generic names (``block``,
``buf``, ``out``) are NOT flagged: they often hold AAD or ciphertext, and
mass-flagging them trains people to silence the gate, which is worse than not
having it.

``ama_secure_memzero()`` is the required replacement: its volatile writes plus
memory barrier defeat the dead-store elimination the as-if rule permits on a
plain ``memset`` whose result is never read (CWE-226).

Scope: ``src/c/**`` and ``tests/c/**`` (``*.c`` and ``*.h``), excluding any
``vendor/`` subtree (third-party code this project does not rewrite).  Tests
are deliberately in scope — a test that bare-memsets a secret exercises the
same anti-pattern.  That sentence predates the second root by some months: the
scan walked ``src/c`` only, so the stated scope was an intention rather than a
behaviour, and two matches in ``tests/c`` went unreported for as long as it
said so.  ``tests/test_c_secret_zeroization_gate.py`` now pins both roots.

Exit status: 0 when clean, 1 on any finding, 2 on a usage error.  A tree with
no C sources is an error, not a pass: that means the scan pointed nowhere.

# memset(DST, 0, ...) with the zero written as 0, 0x00, 0x0, or '\0'.
#
# DST may be a bare identifier (`secret_key`), a member access
# (`ctx->hmac_key`, `st.master_seed`), or either with an index or a leading `&`.
# The name that carries the convention is the LAST identifier in the chain —
# `ctx->hmac_key` is a key because of `hmac_key`, not because of `ctx` — so the
# whole destination expression is captured here and the trailing identifier is
# extracted in _destination_name().
#
# Written to backtrack linearly.  Two shapes in the first draft made it
# polynomial, and CodeQL flagged it (correctly) as a ReDoS:
#
#   `\(\s*&?\s*`  — two nullable quantifiers separated by an optional atom, so
#                   a run of N spaces that ultimately fails to match can be
#                   split between them N ways.
#   `(?:\s*…|\s*\[…\])*` — a starred group whose every alternative begins with
#                   `\s*`, which multiplies the same ambiguity.
#
# Measured on the original: 2,000 spaces 37 ms, 4,000 128 ms, 8,000 516 ms,
# 16,000 2,077 ms — a clean 4x per doubling.  Both are rewritten so each
# quantifier is followed by something that cannot itself match whitespace
# (`&` and the identifier start), which makes the match deterministic:
# 16,000 spaces now costs microseconds.  A .c file with a long run of spaces
# after `memset(` is a strange input, but this tool runs over whatever is in
# the tree, and a gate must not be the thing that hangs CI.
#
# ``\s`` matches newlines, so every quantifier below spans line breaks and the
# pattern matches the multi-line spelling of the call as readily as the
# one-line one — see scan_text(), which applies it to the whole (comment- and
# literal-blanked) file text rather than to each line in isolation.
#
# The optional address-of is written ``(?:(?P<amp>&)\s*)?`` rather than
# ``&?\s*``: every ``\s*`` here is followed by something that cannot itself be
# whitespace (``&`` or an identifier start), which is what keeps the match
# deterministic.  It is captured, not discarded, because the remediation hint
# has to reproduce a destination expression that compiles.
# A leading cast is admitted (``memset((void *)ctx->hmac_key, 0, n)`` is an
# ordinary C spelling, and requiring the destination to START with an
# identifier let it through), and the zero accepts an integer suffix
# (``0U``/``0u``/``0L``).  Both were silent bypasses of an ERROR-severity
# control whose semgrep counterpart is documented as unrunnable, so this regex
# is the only enforcement of INVARIANT-6.
#
# The cast group must also not reintroduce the ReDoS this file was hardened
# against.  Its first form did: ``[A-Za-z0-9_ \t]*`` matched whitespace and was
# followed by ``\**\s*\)``, so on a failing match a whitespace run could be
# split between two quantifiers in O(N) ways and the engine tried all of them
# — measured cleanly quadratic (32k whitespace chars after ``memset((void``
# took 7.7 s, 4x per doubling).  The form below keeps the character classes
# DISJOINT so no position is claimable by two quantifiers: identifier words are
# separated by ``[ \t]+`` that must be followed by an identifier character,
# each pointer ``*`` anchors its own optional whitespace run, and exactly one
# trailing ``[ \t]*`` reaches the closing paren.  Every input therefore has a
# single parse, which is what makes the scan linear rather than usually-fast.
#
# THREE further spellings were reaching past it, each verified as a silent
# bypass on the tree as it stood and each pinned in both directions by
# tests/test_c_secret_zeroization_gate.py:
#
#   * `memset(secret_key, 00, 32)` -- octal zero.  `0[uUlL]*` consumed one
#     `0` and then required a comma, so a second `0` failed the match.  `0+`
#     fixes it and cannot be ambiguous: it is followed by a suffix class that
#     excludes digits.
#   * `memset(secret_key, (0), 32)` -- a parenthesized zero, which C
#     programmers write constantly inside macro bodies.
#   * `memset(secret_key + 4, 0, 28)` -- pointer arithmetic on the
#     destination.  Zeroing the tail of a secret buffer is still zeroing
#     secret state, and _destination_name already resolves the leading
#     identifier, so admitting the offset costs nothing but the match.
#
# The ReDoS constraint from the cast group governs each addition, and this
# file has acquired that defect twice already:
#   * `0+` sits alone before `[uUlL]*` (digits and suffix letters are
#     disjoint), so a digit run has exactly one parse.
#   * The optional parens around the value are a fixed pair with one `\s*`
#     each, and the value alternation cannot match `(` or `)`, so no position
#     is claimable by two quantifiers.
#   * The offset tail is `(?:[ \t]*[-+][ \t]*<term>)*` where <term> starts
#     with a character class disjoint from `[ \t]` and from `[-+]`, so a
#     whitespace run again has one parse.
# tests/test_c_secret_zeroization_gate.py pins the growth ratio at ~2.0x per
# doubling (linear), which is what caught both earlier regressions.
