AMA Cryptography — no divide instruction may take a secret operand.

Why this exists
---------------
KyberSlash is this defect class: ML-KEM's ``Compress_d`` is written as a
division by ``q``, the compiler is *usually* free to lower it to a reciprocal
multiply, and where it does not, the emitted ``div`` has operand-dependent
latency over a secret-derived numerator.  That is a practical key-recovery
channel, and this repository shipped it once — the pull request that carried
the fix is titled for it.

The fix was a Granlund-Montgomery reciprocal in ``src/c/ama_kyber.c``.  What
was never added is anything that would notice the fix being undone.  Reading
the C does not settle it either way: the source says ``/``, the object may or
may not contain a ``div``, and only the object decides.  So this gate reads
the object.

What it does
------------
Disassembles the built library, attributes every ``div``/``idiv`` to the
symbol it lands in, and compares that inventory against :data:`ALLOWED`.
Anything not listed, or listed with a smaller count, fails.

Allowlisting a symbol requires stating why its operands are public.  A count
is recorded with it so that *new* divides in an already-listed function still
fail — the usual way a real one hides is next to a benign one.

Non-vacuity
-----------
The mistake this gate is most likely to make is finding nothing because it
looked at nothing: a stripped object, a symbol that got inlined away, a
disassembler that failed silently.  Measured during this gate's own
development — a first version reported "0 divides in kyber_compress_d" and
was believed, when the truth was that ``kyber_compress_d`` is ``static``, is
fully inlined, and has no symbol to search.  So the gate asserts a floor on
what it managed to read before it is allowed to report a clean result.

Exit status
-----------
0  every divide in the object is on a public operand
1  a divide appeared in a symbol that is not allowlisted, or above its
   recorded count
2  the gate could not read what it needs, or read too little to be believed

#: Symbols permitted to contain divide instructions, with the count measured
#: on this tree and the reason the operands are public.  A divide anywhere
#: else, or more of them here, fails.
#:
#: These are EXACT measured counts, not measured+tolerance.  ``count > ceiling``
#: is the failure condition (see below), so the clean object passes at equality
#: and a single added divide trips the gate.  "Fewer is fine" still holds -- a
#: compiler that folds a PUBLIC divide only lowers the count, and a divide on
#: secret operands cannot be constant-folded -- so only an INCREASE fails.
#:
#: History (audit H1): these first sat far above the measured counts
#: (dil_sign_internal 24 vs 14, lms_verify_parsed 16 vs 11, ama_argon2id_core
#: 12 vs 6: 21 free slots), then were pinned to measured+2.  Even +2 was not
#: free -- a minimised secret division lowers to exactly two machine divides, so
#: ``count == ceiling`` at measured+2 let the very KyberSlash defect class this
#: gate exists to catch pass.  The +2 was justified as cross-compiler/cross-arch
#: unrolling spread, but there is none to tolerate for these symbols: the gate
#: reads only gcc-built objects in CI (build-shared, x86-64, in dudect.yml;
#: build-arm, aarch64, in arm-qemu.yml), and gcc-13 -O3 emits the IDENTICAL count
#: on both -- 14/14, 11/11, 6/6 (measured on both shared objects, 2026-08).  A
#: future toolchain that unrolls one of these loops differently will raise the
#: count and fail LOUDLY: that is the correct place to require a human to
#: re-confirm the new divides are still on public operands and re-measure this
#: table under review, never a standing +N that quietly banks slack for an
#: attacker.
