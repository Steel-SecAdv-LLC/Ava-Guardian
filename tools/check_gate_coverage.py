AMA Cryptography — Aggregating Gate Coverage Verifier (INVARIANT-31)
====================================================================

Verifies that every job which runs on a pull request is actually capable of
blocking that pull request.

Why this exists
---------------
Branch protection on this repository requires the *aggregating gate* context
of each primary workflow (``ci-gate``, ``static-analysis-gate``,
``fuzzing-gate``, …) rather than the individual job names.  That design is
deliberate and documented in each gate's own comment: it means adding,
renaming, or matrix-expanding a job updates a ``needs:`` list under code
review instead of drifting the branch-protection configuration out of sync
(*required-context drift*).

The design has one failure mode, and it is silent in the worst possible
direction.  A job that is **not** listed in its workflow's gate ``needs:``
still runs, still reports its own red X on the pull request — and still
cannot block a merge, because branch protection never evaluates its context.
The pull request shows a failing check next to a green required gate, and
"all required checks passed" is true.

That is not hypothetical here.  ``c-library-no-native-pqc`` in
``ci-build-test.yml`` guards the ``AMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=OFF`` configuration —
the build for consumers who take the library without native post-quantum
support.  It was absent from ``ci-gate``'s ``needs:`` while commit ``f3dd0c2``
of this branch had to repair that exact configuration after it broke
undetected.  The guard job existed, ran, and gated nothing.

Every gate comment in this repository asserts "every job in this workflow
runs unconditionally … so each MUST be ``success``".  This checker is what
makes that sentence true rather than aspirational.

What is checked
---------------
``gate presence``
    A workflow that triggers on ``pull_request`` and defines more than one
    job must define an aggregating gate job.  Single-job workflows are
    exempt: the job *is* its own status context, so there is nothing to
    aggregate.  Workflows that never trigger on ``pull_request`` (``release.yml``
    on a tag push, ``wiki-sync.yml`` on a push to main) are exempt: branch
    protection cannot require a context they never produce.

``gate coverage``
    Every non-gate job in a workflow must appear in the ``needs:`` of some
    gate job in that workflow.  ``needs:`` is workflow-local, so each
    workflow is checked independently.

``gate reachability``
    Every gate job must carry a job-level ``if: always()``.  Without it the
    gate is *skipped* when any dependency fails, and a required context that
    reports ``skipped`` never resolves — the pull request sits on "Expected —
    waiting for status check to be reported" indefinitely rather than going
    red.  A gate that cannot report red is not a gate.

Both directions are pinned by ``tests/test_gate_coverage.py``, so this gate
cannot silently degrade into a no-op.
