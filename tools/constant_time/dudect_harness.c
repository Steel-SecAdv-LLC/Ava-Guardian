/**
 * dudect-style Timing Analysis Harness for Constant-Time Verification
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * This harness implements statistical timing analysis to detect timing
 * leakage in constant-time implementations. It uses Welch's t-test to
 * compare execution times between two input classes.
 *
 * Based on the dudect methodology:
 * - Reparaz, O., Balasch, J., & Verbauwhede, I. (2017).
 *   "Dude, is my code constant time?"
 *   https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1123.pdf
 *
 * Usage:
 *   gcc -O2 -I../../include dudect_harness.c -o dudect_harness -lm
 *   ./dudect_harness [iterations]
 *
 * A t-value under DUDECT_CROPPED_T_THRESHOLD suggests no detectable timing
 * leakage at the 99.999% confidence level.  That threshold is calibrated in
 * dudect_percentile.h against the statistic this harness actually computes —
 * a maximum over 21 percentile rungs.  4.5 is the critical value of a single
 * Welch t, which is not what is being compared, and is what these harnesses
 * used to test the maximum against.

/* Rounds are re-run to separate a reproducible finding from runner noise; the

 * resolves the BULK of the timing distribution, which is what makes it detect
 * a real leak where the raw statistic could not — and it also stops averaging
 * the shared runner's noise away into an inflated variance, so a noisy round
 * now lands nearer the threshold than it used to.  Under a majority rule with
 * three rounds, two noise excursions of the same sign are a FAIL.
 *
 * Observed: `Ascon-AEAD128 encrypt` reached +6.4478 in 2 of 3 rounds on a CI
 * runner, on C code byte-identical to a run where the same job passed.  That
 * lane's true effect is ~0 and was measured to be so: |t| does not scale with

 * 200,000, -1.75 at 800,000, where a genuine data-dependent effect would grow
 * as sqrt(n) (16x the samples, ~4x the statistic).  Its setup is already
 * symmetric: both keys built before the loop, branchless pointer select,
 * nothing class-dependent between the class choice and the timer.
 *
 * Requiring three of five instead of two of three raises the evidence a
 * verdict needs WITHOUT touching the threshold or the statistic.  It cannot
 * hide a real leak: a leak reproduces in every round -- the deliberately
 * early-exiting memcmp used to validate this statistic reports |t| = 225-232
 * in each one -- while noise has to clear the threshold three times with a
