AMA Cryptography — Workflow Command Verifier (INVARIANT-25)
===========================================================

Statically verifies the parts of ``.github/workflows/**`` that only fail when
the workflow actually runs — and therefore, for a workflow that runs only on a
tag push, only fail on release day.

Why this exists
---------------
``release.yml`` triggers on ``push: tags: ['v*']`` and nothing else.  Every
defect below sat in it undetected across multiple releases, each one on its
own sufficient to produce a release with zero binary artefacts:

1. **A retired runner label.**  The wheel matrix named ``macos-13`` after
   GitHub retired that image.  The job never received a runner: it queued
   until ``timeout-minutes`` expired, failed ``build-wheels``, and took every
   downstream stage with it.

2. **An inline Python payload broken by YAML folding.**  ``CIBW_TEST_COMMAND``
   was a folded scalar (``>-``), which joins the block's lines with a space.
   The payload reaching the interpreter began with a leading space::

       python -c " import ama_cryptography as a; ..."
                   ^ IndentationError: unexpected indent

   Every wheel built correctly on every platform and then failed this command.

3. **POSIX quoting sent to ``cmd.exe``.**  ``CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_WINDOWS`` used
   single quotes to protect ``>=`` from shell redirection.  ``cmd.exe`` does
   not treat a single quote as a quoting operator, so pip received the quote
   as part of the requirement and every Windows wheel job died on
   ``Invalid requirement: "'cmake"``.

4. **Release-publishing inputs incompatible with immutable releases.**  Three
   defects in one step, all invisible until a tag was pushed: a ``name:`` that
   reset a hand-edited release title, a ``body:`` that destroyed hand-edited
   release notes, and a prerelease that published before its assets uploaded.
   See :func:`check_release_publishing` for the mechanics.

Each is a *latent outage*, not a style issue, and each is decidable without
running anything.  This checker decides them on the pull request that
introduces them.

What is checked
---------------
``runner labels``
    Every ``runs-on:`` value and every matrix ``os:`` entry must name a
    GitHub-hosted label that currently exists.  Retired labels are reported
    with what replaced them; unrecognised labels fail closed rather than
    being assumed valid.  Expressions (``${{ matrix.os }}``) are resolved
    through the job's own ``strategy.matrix`` where possible and skipped
    otherwise — a label this checker cannot resolve is never silently passed
    off as verified, it is counted separately and reported.

``inline python payloads``
    Any ``python -c "<payload>"`` appearing in a ``run:`` block or in an
    environment value is extracted and handed to :func:`compile`.  A payload
    that does not compile fails the build here rather than on the runner.

``windows shell quoting``
    Command strings that are Windows-specific by construction — the
    ``*_WINDOWS`` cibuildwheel variables, and ``run:`` steps declaring
    ``shell: cmd`` — must not use POSIX single-quoting around arguments.

``cmake build type``
    Every ``cmake`` *configure* in a ``run:`` block must state its optimization
    level, either with ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` or with an explicit ``-O`` inside
    ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS``.  This project sets no default build type, so a configure
    that names neither compiles with no ``-O`` flag at all — which is how ten
    instruction-count constant-time gates came to be measuring an unoptimized
    library.  See :func:`check_cmake_build_type`.

``release publishing``
    Steps using ``softprops/action-gh-release`` must not silently overwrite
    release text a maintainer edited by hand, and must not publish a
    prerelease before its assets have uploaded.  The rules are derived from
    the action's own resolution logic; see :func:`check_release_publishing`.

``pytest prerequisites``
    Since 5.0.0 a failed FIPS 140-3 power-on self-test makes ``import
    ama_cryptography`` *raise*, and ``tests/conftest.py`` performs that import
    from ``pytest_configure``.  So a workflow step that invokes pytest in a job
    that never built the native library does not run one test and report a
    skip — it dies with ``INTERNALERROR`` and exit 3 before collection.  Every
    pytest-invoking step must therefore be preceded, in its own job, either by
    a step that builds the library or by ``AMA_POST_DIAGNOSTIC_IMPORT``, which
    completes the import with cryptography still refused.  See
    :func:`check_pytest_prerequisites`.

Known limitation, stated plainly
--------------------------------
The runner-label set is curated, not queried: GitHub publishes no API that
enumerates available hosted labels.  So this check catches a label that is
already known-retired, a typo, and a label that never existed — but it cannot
predict a *future* retirement.  The authoritative detector for that is a
manual dry run of the release workflow (``workflow_dispatch``,
``dry_run: true``) before cutting a tag.  Re-verify the table below against
https://github.com/actions/runner-images#available-images when a retirement
is announced.

Exit status
-----------
``0`` when every check passes, ``1`` when any check fails.

    Immutable releases freeze a release's tag and assets at publish time; the
    title and notes stay editable.  That makes the intended flow *publish via
    the workflow, then edit the text by hand* — and it makes two of this
    action's inputs destructive, because a workflow re-run for the same tag
    takes the action's ``updateRelease`` path and overwrites what was edited.

    All three rules below are read off the action's own resolution logic
    rather than its documentation:

    ``name``
        ``updateRelease`` resolves ``input_name || existingRelease.name ||
        tag``.  Passing a name therefore replaces a hand-edited title with
        whatever the workflow hardcodes.  Omitting it is not a regression for
        a first run: ``createRelease`` already falls back to ``input_name ||
        tag``, which is the bare tag either way.

    ``body`` / ``body_path`` without ``append_body``
        The body resolves as ``workflowBody || existingReleaseBody`` unless
        ``append_body`` is set, in which case an existing body is preserved
        and the workflow's text is appended to it.  Without the flag a re-run
        silently destroys the release notes.  ``createRelease`` never consults
        ``append_body``, so setting it costs a first run nothing.

    ``prerelease`` without ``draft``
        ``createRelease`` computes ``draft = prerelease === true ?
        input_draft === true : true`` — only a *non*-prerelease is drafted
        automatically.  A prerelease is therefore published immediately, its
        assets freeze, and the upload that follows fails with *Cannot upload
        assets to an immutable release*.  Checked only when the step actually
        uploads ``files``: with no assets there is nothing for the freeze to
        catch.

    An expression (``${{ ... }}``) counts as neither true nor false.  A step
    that drives ``draft`` from the same expression as ``prerelease`` has
    handled the case, and this checker does not second-guess a value it
    cannot evaluate.

    ``dudect-legacy-harnesses`` configures CMake — but without

    ``tools/constant_time`` harnesses.  A ``./build/bin/test_dudect`` invocation
    added to that job is therefore a guaranteed ``exit 127``, and that is not a
    hypothetical: it shipped, on this branch, from an edit that inserted the same
    line into every run step in the file and matched one more step than intended.

    Nothing caught it before CI did, because the mistake is invisible at the
    point it is made — the line is correct in the four jobs above and below it.
    The property that distinguishes them is not in the workflow at all, it is in
    ``tests/c/CMakeLists.txt``: the target sits inside ``if(AMA_ENABLE_DUDECT)``,
    and that option defaults ``OFF``.

    So the guard is read from CMake and matched against each job's own configure
    flags.  Only options that default ``OFF`` are required explicitly; a target
    behind an ON-by-default guard is built without anyone asking, and demanding
    the flag would be noise.

    ---------------
    ``CMakeLists.txt`` sets no default ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``, and every
    optimization flag this project adds lives in ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE`` /
    ``_DEBUG``.  A configure that names no build type therefore compiles the
    library with **no** ``-O`` flag at all — not "the default", not "-O2", but
    unoptimized — and nothing in the log says so.

    That is not a style matter.  ``dudect.yml`` built the AMA_TESTING_MODE
    archive that way and ran all ten instruction-count constant-time targets
    against it.  Those targets exist to catch a transformation the *optimizer*
    performs (see ``src/c/internal/ama_ct_barrier.h``), so at ``-O0`` there was
    nothing for them to find and every one reported PASS.  Rebuilt at ``-O3``,
    ``--target ecdsa`` immediately measured a 9,424-instruction key-dependent
    spread in the secp256k1 scalar arithmetic under clang 18: a live Montgomery
    extra-reduction leak on the ECDSA signing path, which the gate had been
    passing over for as long as it had built the library the way it did.

    A job may legitimately want the unoptimized configuration — the strict
    warning sweep builds it deliberately, because some diagnostics only appear
    without the optimizer and some only with it.  What it may not do is leave
    that unstated: ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None`` says "no configuration flags, on
    purpose" in CMake's own vocabulary, and is accepted here.  An explicit
    ``-O`` inside ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` (what the sanitizer jobs pass) is likewise
    a statement of intent and is accepted.
