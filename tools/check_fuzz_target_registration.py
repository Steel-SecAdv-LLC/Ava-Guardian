AMA Cryptography — Fuzz Target Registration Verifier (INVARIANT-33)
===================================================================

Verifies that every fuzz harness in ``fuzz/`` is registered in all three
places that must know about it, and that none of those places names a target
that does not exist.

Why this exists
---------------
A fuzz target is registered in three independent lists:

* ``fuzz/CMakeLists.txt`` — ``FUZZ_CORE_TARGETS`` / ``FUZZ_PQC_TARGETS``,
  which decide what the local and CI builds compile;
* ``.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml`` — the job matrix, which decides what the
  per-PR fuzz lane actually runs;
* ``oss-fuzz/build.sh`` — ``FUZZ_TARGETS``, which decides what Google's
  OSS-Fuzz infrastructure builds and runs continuously.

Python harnesses under ``fuzz/python/`` have one registry rather than three —
they are not libFuzzer targets, so only the workflow runs them — and the same
rule applies: a harness that exists and is never run is indistinguishable from
one that finds nothing.

Nothing tied them together.  ``oss-fuzz/build.sh`` even carries the comment
"Keep in sync with fuzz/CMakeLists.txt" — and had drifted anyway:
``fuzz_agent_binding`` was added to the CMake lists and to the workflow matrix
when the agent-binding layer landed, and never to ``build.sh``.  OSS-Fuzz
therefore never built it, and the omission was invisible because
``build.sh`` skips a missing target with a warning and exits 0.

That is the worst shape a coverage gap can take: the target exists, it is
tested in CI, and the continuous fuzzing that is supposed to run it for
months on end silently does not.  A harness nobody runs is indistinguishable
from a harness that finds nothing.

What is checked
---------------
The set of ``fuzz/fuzz_*.c`` files must equal the union of the two CMake
lists, must equal the workflow matrix, and must equal the ``build.sh`` array.
Any target present in one list and absent from another is reported with the
direction of the drift, as is a list entry with no corresponding source file.

Both directions are pinned by ``tests/test_fuzz_target_registration.py``.

Usage
-----
::

    python tools/check_fuzz_target_registration.py

Exits 0 when all four sets agree, 1 otherwise.
