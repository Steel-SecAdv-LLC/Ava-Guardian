"""Rebuild the vendored key-format conformance corpus from its upstream sources.

``tests/test_key_formats.py`` runs **offline** against a fixed corpus under
``tests/kat/keyformats/``. This tool is the other half of that contract: it
re-derives that corpus from the documents it came from, so a reviewer can prove
the vendored bytes are the specifications' own, and can regenerate them when a
document is revised.

One kind of source, and only one: **the standards bodies' own answer keys**.
RFC 9881 Appendix C, draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates Appendix C, RFC 8410
§10, RFC 8037 Appendix A, RFC 8152 Appendix C.7 and RFC 9500 §2.3 all publish
worked examples — vectors published so an implementer needs no second party to
check against. They are fetched from ``rfc-editor.org`` / ``ietf.org``, parsed
out of the running text, and written as JSON.

This corpus deliberately contains **no output from any other cryptographic
product**. Where a specification publishes no vector, the substitute is a
reference encoder written from the specification's own ASN.1 text
(``tests/ref_keyformat.py``), which is AMA's work and stands on the document
rather than on another implementation's behaviour. RFC 5915 and RFC 5480 were
long the gap here, and RFC 9500 — "Standard Public Key Cryptography (PKCS) Test
Keys", December 2023 — closed it: its §2.3 prints P-256/P-384/P-521 keys in
exactly the RFC 5915 ``ECPrivateKey`` form AMA embeds in PKCS#8.

Nothing here is a runtime dependency. These are checked-in data consumed by CI,
exactly as ``wycheproof_vectors/`` is.

Where this runs
---------------
``--verify`` is not a command a reviewer has to remember. It is driven on every
pull request from two directions: ``tests/test_keyformat_corpus_provenance.py``
calls :func:`verify_offline` directly (and pins each failure direction, so the
check cannot decay into one that always passes), and the ``security-checks`` job
in ``ci.yml`` runs the CLI. (It said ``code-quality``, which sent a reviewer
following the docstring to confirm the gate is wired to the wrong job, where
they found nothing.) ``--verify-upstream`` needs the network, so it runs
where the Wycheproof corpus's equivalent does: ``corpus-provenance.yml``, on a
monthly drift watch and on any pull request that touches the corpus or this
tool.

Usage::

    python3 tools/build_keyformat_corpus.py --specs           # refresh from RFCs
    python3 tools/build_keyformat_corpus.py --verify          # offline: re-parse only
    python3 tools/build_keyformat_corpus.py --verify-upstream # online: vs. the documents
