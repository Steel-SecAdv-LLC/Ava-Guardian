AMA Cryptography — dudect class-staging gate

A dudect lane compares two input classes, and the two classes must differ in
the property under test and in NOTHING ELSE.  Handing the timed call one of
two per-class buffers breaks that: the classes then differ in the input's
ADDRESS as well as its value, and a load's timing legitimately depends on its
address — which cache line it falls in, whether it spans two, which set it
maps to.

Why that needs a gate rather than a comment
-------------------------------------------
Unlike scheduler noise, an address bias is FIXED for a given binary on a given
host.  It therefore reproduces in every round with the same sign, which is
precisely the shape the multi-round majority rule and the direction rule in
``tests/c/dudect/dudect_rounds.h`` are unable to tell apart from a leak.  No
threshold and no number of rounds separates them; only the experiment's design
does.

The size of the effect is measured, not asserted.  With the
Ascon-AEAD128-encrypt lane's own cipher call and *identical key data in both
classes* — so the true effect is exactly zero — placing class 0's key across
two cache lines while class 1's sits inside one drives the cropped statistic
to |t| = 13.5..30.9, over threshold in 10 of 10 runs, all one sign.  Staged
through a single buffer the same measurement reports 0 of 10.

This became reachable when the harnesses adopted percentile cropping, which
resolves the BULK of the timing distribution: for that lane the cropped bulk
has a standard deviation near 4 ns over ~22,000 samples per class, so the
standard error is about 0.04 ns and the threshold is crossed by a systematic
difference of roughly 0.2 ns — under half a cycle at 2.1 GHz.

Staging the destination is only half of it
------------------------------------------
The first version of this gate sanctioned::

    dudect_stage(buf, class_idx ? A : B, sizeof buf)

which fixes the address the *timed call* reads but leaves the SELECTION inside
the loop, between the class draw and the opening timer.  That keeps two
class-correlated effects in the window the measurement is most sensitive to:
the ternary is a conditional branch perfectly correlated with the class, whose
misprediction penalty is paid just before the timer opens and retires inside
the timed region on an out-of-order core; and ``A`` and ``B`` are two distinct
objects, so the staging copy's own source address is class-correlated too.

Measured with the AES-GCM forgery-position lane's own decrypt call and
BYTE-IDENTICAL input in both classes — true effect exactly zero — at 500,000
measurements per run, 8 runs per batch, threshold 5.0:

===================================================  ==============  =========
construction                                          over threshold  worst |t|
===================================================  ==============  =========
two sources + ternary select (the old sanctioned      4/8, 4/8, 1/8       7.85
form)
one aligned two-entry source, indexed (no branch)          0/8            2.79
two sources, branch-free pointer select                    0/8            2.18
one aligned two-entry source + ternary select              0/8            4.47
both sources merged under a mask                           0/8            3.01
===================================================  ==============  =========

The branch is the dominant term: the two constructions that keep it are the
only ones that trip or drift toward the threshold.  ``dudect_harness.c`` had
already measured the same effect twice from the other direction — a branchy
class setup gave mean t = +43.38 (10/10 over threshold) against +1.26 (0/10)
for the branchless form, and +9.93 (15/15) against -0.02 (0/15) on a function
callgrind proves retires an identical instruction count for every class.  The
discipline existed in the older harness and was not carried into the newer
lanes.

The rule
--------
Between the class draw and the timer call that opens the measured region, no
statement may branch on the class or use it to select an address.  Concretely,
in that window ``class_idx`` may appear only:

* as the trailing argument of ``dudect_stage_select(dst, src0, src1, n,
  class_idx)`` — which reads BOTH class inputs every iteration and merges them
  under a constant-time mask, so neither the branch history nor the address
  stream entering the timer is class-correlated, at any input size; or
* in branchless arithmetic that constructs the class input itself, e.g.
  ``memset(buf, (int)(0xFF * (unsigned)class_idx), n)`` or
  ``b[pos] ^= (uint8_t)class_idx``.

A ternary on the class, an ``if`` on the class, or a ``[class_idx]`` index is a
violation wherever it appears in that window.  After the timer closes the
window the class is unconstrained: the next iteration's class is drawn
independently, so branch history carried across iterations cannot bias it.

The gate also requires every staging buffer to be declared ``_Alignas(64)``:
an unaligned staging buffer can straddle a cache line, which reintroduces the
very asymmetry the staging removes — just for both classes at once, which
inflates the noise floor instead of biasing the mean.

Why a gate and not review
-------------------------
This discipline has now been discovered three times in this tree — twice in
``dudect_harness.c`` and once in the AES-GCM tag-compare lane — and each time
it failed to propagate to the lanes written next.  The shipped AES-GCM
forgery-position lane read |t| = 61..75 with a consistent sign on two
different CI hosts while the decrypt it measures executes a bit-identical
instruction stream for both classes.  A property that has regressed three
times is a property that needs enforcement rather than a comment.

Exit status
-----------
0  every dudect lane reaches its timer with no class-dependent branch or
   address selection in front of it
1  at least one lane branches on the class or selects an address by it before
   the timer, a staging buffer is not cache-line aligned, or a class draw is
   not followed by a timer call at all
2  a file this gate must examine is missing (fail closed — a gate whose input
   vanished must not pass)
