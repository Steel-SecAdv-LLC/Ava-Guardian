Verify every count the documentation pins against the thing it counts.

Why
---
``docs/KEY_FORMATS.md`` said "``tests/test_key_formats.py`` — 301 tests". It was
true when it was written. Nothing checked it, so the only question was how long
until it stopped being true — and a documented number that has quietly gone
wrong is worse than no number, because a reader takes it as evidence and a
maintainer takes it as a baseline.

The same shape appears throughout: "15 vectors", "1530 vectors across …",
"41 tests". Each is a second declaration of a fact that lives somewhere else —
the same class of duplication ``check_version_consistency.py`` polices for
version strings, and the same failure mode.

So rather than deleting the numbers (they are genuinely useful — "the negative
space is 300 tests" tells a reviewer something "there are tests" does not), they
are *checked*.

What is checked
---------------
Five claim shapes, recognised anywhere under ``docs/``, ``tests/`` and the
repository root:

1. ``tests/<name>.py`` — N tests``  → pytest's own collection count.
2. ``<name>.json`` — N records``    → the corpus file's ``records`` array.
3. ``wycheproof_vectors/`` — N vectors across `a`, `b`, `c``
                                    → the manifest's per-file ``actualTests``.
4. ``N native entry points`` / ``N Cython binding entry points``
                                    → ``tools/check_error_state_gating.py``,
                                      which those documents already name as
                                      authoritative while carrying a figure
                                      that had drifted away from it.
5. ``N C test suites (M translation units)``
                                    → ``tests/c/**/test_*.c`` and
                                      ``tests/c/**/*.c``.  Adding a C test used
                                      to move both numbers with nothing
                                      watching.

A claim naming a file that does not exist is a failure too: a count for a
deleted corpus is the most misleading kind.

Exit code:
    0  every documented count matches
    1  at least one has drifted

#: nothing was gated, and both columns drifted. Then the Files column was
#: gated (4.0.0) while the line totals were left out on the argument that
#: "``wc -l`` moves on every commit and a gate that fails on every commit is
#: one that gets disabled" — and the totals drifted again, silently, within
#: two days of being re-measured (measured at 8d72b8c: four of seven totals
#: stale). The argument identified a real operational cost but drew the
#: wrong conclusion: the fix for "the gate fails whenever the tree changes"
#: is a one-command regenerator, not an ungated number. ``python
#: tools/update_docs.py --loc`` rewrites every gated figure from the same
#: measurement functions this checker verifies with, so keeping the gate
#: green after a change is one command, and a figure that was not
#: re-measured cannot survive review.
#:
#: Counting rules, stated exactly (the report publishes the matching
#: reproduction commands): files are enumerated with ``git ls-files`` —
#: tracked files only, so virtualenvs, build directories and generated
#: ``src/cython/*.c`` can never leak into a measurement — and lines are
#: counted as ``\n`` bytes per file (exact ``wc -l`` semantics,
#: locale-independent; trailing-newline-free files under-count by one).
#: For a directory that is not a git checkout (this gate's own test
#: fixtures) the enumeration falls back to a sorted filesystem walk
#: excluding ``.git``; the real repository always takes the git path.

# Fuzz-target count.
#
# How many libFuzzer harnesses the repository builds is a fact that lives in
# ``fuzz/CMakeLists.txt`` and is already enforced, harness by harness, by
# ``tools/check_fuzz_target_registration.py``.  The prose restates it — README,
# ARCHITECTURE.md, ENHANCED_FEATURES.md, CRYPTO_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md,
# docs/oss-fuzz-onboarding.md and THREAT_MODEL.md each quote a target count —
# and, unchecked, those restatements had drifted to 11, 12, 13 and 16 across
# six documents, only one of which stated the correct 15, against a tree that
# builds fifteen.  This checks them against the one authority instead of
# maintaining another number by hand: the count is *imported* from the
# registration tool, never re-derived here, so the two cannot disagree.
#
# ``fuzz_rng.c`` is a support translation unit — it supplies
# ``__wrap_ama_randombytes`` to ``fuzz_frost`` — not a harness, which is why the
# authority is "libFuzzer entry points" (15), not "``fuzz_*.c`` files" (16). A
# document may legitimately state either, so only the entry-point figure — the
# one that says how many fuzzers actually run — is gated; the source-file count
# is left to the prose.
#: Bounded for the same reason as _AGGREGATE_RE above: ``\d+``, ``[\w-]*``
#: and ``\s+`` were all unbounded (4.1x per doubling, 363 ms at 6,000 chars).

#:
