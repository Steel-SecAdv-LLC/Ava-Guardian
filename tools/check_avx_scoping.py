"""CPUID-gated instructions must stay inside their dedicated kernels.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
Audit M3.  Of the three principal findings in the SIMD-scoping work, two shipped
with a regression gate and one did not.  KyberSlash got ``check_secret_division.py``,
which disassembles the built object.  The SVE2 kernels got the ``arm-qemu-sve2``
lane.  The AVX2-scoping fix -- confining ``-mavx2`` to the ``src/c/avx2``
translation units instead of applying it library-wide -- got a CMake comment.

That fix is real and load-bearing: with a global ``-mavx2`` the compiler
auto-vectorises the *entire* library with 256-bit YMM instructions, so a build
selects AVX2 code at run time on a CPU that may not have it -- the #UD-on-a-
non-AVX2-host failure mode the per-file scoping exists to prevent.  Reintroducing
global ``-mavx2`` builds clean and passes the functional suite; nothing kept the
property holding.  This gate does.

AVX2 was not the only per-file ISA flag
--------------------------------------
The gate was written for ``-mavx2`` because that is where the audit found the
defect, and it checked YMM/ZMM operands only.  But ``CMakeLists.txt`` scopes
**six** families of CPUID-gated instructions per file, not one:

  ===================================  ============================================
  per-file flags                       translation units
  ===================================  ============================================
  ``-mavx2``                           ``src/c/avx2/*``
  ``-mavx512f -mavx512vl``             ``src/c/avx512/*``
  ``-maes -mpclmul``                   ``src/c/avx2/ama_aes_gcm{,_vaes}_avx2.c``
  ``-mvaes -mvpclmulqdq``              ``src/c/avx2/ama_aes_gcm_vaes_avx2.c``
  ``-msha -mssse3 -msse4.1``           ``src/c/ama_sha256_ni.c``
  ``-mbmi -mbmi2``, ``-mbmi2 -madx``   ``src/c/x86/*``, ``src/c/internal/*_mulx.c``
  ===================================  ============================================

Every one of those raises the same hazard in the same way: make the flag global
and the compiler is free to emit that ISA anywhere, including in the portable
fallback the runtime dispatcher selects **because** the CPU lacks the feature —
and the result is a #UD on a host the wheel claims to support.  A gate that
covers one sixth of the surface leaves the other five to a CMake comment, which
is precisely the state the audit found ``-mavx2`` in.

What it enforces
----------------
It disassembles the built object and, for each ISA family in
:data:`ISA_FAMILIES`, records every symbol whose body contains an instruction
from that family and fails on any such symbol that is not a kernel for it.  A
symbol is kernel code for a family when

  * its name carries one of that family's markers -- ``_avx2`` / ``_avx512``
    for vector code, ``_shani`` for the SHA extensions, ``_bmi`` / ``_mulx``
    for the general-purpose ones -- including the ``.part`` / ``.constprop`` /
    ``.isra`` fragments the compiler splits them into, or
  * it is one of the file-local helpers in that family's allowlist, each
    defined in a scoped translation unit but not named for it.

An occurrence anywhere else is the global-flag regression: a symbol that is not
a kernel has been given instructions the dispatcher never gated on a CPUID
check.

Deliberately NOT checked
------------------------
``tzcnt``, ``lzcnt`` and ``popcnt``.  ``tzcnt`` is encoded as ``rep bsf`` and
executes as ``bsf`` on a CPU without BMI1 -- wrong for a zero input, but never
a fault -- so flagging it would report a portability hazard that does not
exist.  ``lzcnt``/``popcnt`` sit behind ABM/POPCNT rather than behind any flag
this build scopes per file.  XMM operands are likewise excluded: 128-bit SSE2
is baseline x86-64.  The SSSE3 and SSE4.1 families ARE checked, because
``-mssse3``/``-msse4.1`` are per-file flags here and neither is baseline
(``-march=x86-64`` is SSE2).

Exit status
-----------
0  every CPUID-gated instruction lives in a kernel scoped for its ISA
1  a non-kernel symbol carries one, OR a required kernel symbol is missing or
   carries none (the build this gate exists to check did not actually happen)
2  the object could not be read (missing, no disassembler, or below the
   non-vacuity floor) -- a clean result over an object nothing disassembled
   would be a false pass
