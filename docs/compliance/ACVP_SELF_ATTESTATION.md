## 1. Scope Statement

This document formally attests to the results of running official NIST ACVP
test vectors against the AMA Cryptography library. It restructures the
evidence in [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md`](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md) into a
customer-facing format.

### 1.1 What IS Covered

- **Algorithm correctness** against NIST ACVP Algorithm Functional Test (AFT)
  vectors for **12 algorithm functions** across **7 NIST standards**
  (FIPS 180-4, FIPS 198-1, FIPS 202, FIPS 203, FIPS 204, FIPS 205, SP 800-38D),
  plus **Monte Carlo Test (MCT)** coverage for the four SHA-3 family
  algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-512, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256) added on the
  2.1.5 line (see `coverage_changelog` in the attestation JSON).
- **Deterministic, reproducible** pass/fail results against upstream
  `usnistgov/ACVP-Server` vector projections, plus published FIPS/SP
  reference vectors for SHA-256 and AES-256-GCM.
- **Native C implementation** of post-quantum algorithms (no external PQC
  libraries — no liboqs, no PQClean).

### 1.2 What is NOT Covered

This attestation **does not** represent, claim, or imply any of the following:

- NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) validation or
  CAVP certificate.
- NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) certification.
- FIPS 140-3 compliance, validation, or accreditation at any security level.
- Side-channel resistance guarantees (timing, power, EM, cache).
- Implementation correctness beyond the specific AFT and SHA-3 MCT test
  vectors listed in §3. Large Data Test (LDT) groups, Variable Output Test
  (VOT) groups, MCT for non-SHA-3 algorithms, non-byte-aligned inputs, and
  non-target parameter sets are out of scope (see §4).
- A substitute for an independent third-party cryptographic audit.
- NIST endorsement of any kind.

| **TOTAL** | | | | **1,215** | **1,215** | **100%** |

The four SHA-3 family rows include **100 Monte Carlo Test (MCT) vectors each
(400 total)** on top of the existing AFT coverage. MCT was added on the
2.1.5 line (see `coverage_changelog` in the attestation JSON for the
exact library version and date); implementation lives in
`nist_vectors/run_vectors.py::_run_sha3_mct` and `_run_shake_mct`. The
FIPS-202 MCT spec is a 100 outer × 1000 inner per-tcId iteration over a
single seed, so 1 tcId per algorithm contributes 100 scored vectors
under the per-resultsArray-entry accounting convention.

**5,789 vectors were skipped total**, split into two buckets by the kind
of thing that was skipped:

- **4,667 AFT-filtered skips** — individual vectors filtered out *within*
  AFT (Algorithm Functional Test) groups: non-byte-aligned inputs,
  non-target parameter sets (ML-KEM-512/768, ML-DSA-44/87, SLH-DSA
  non-SHA2-256f), and ML-DSA / SLH-DSA internal and pre-hash test groups.
  This is the number reported by
  `nist_vectors/results.json::summary.total_skipped`, aggregated from
  each algorithm's `vectors_skipped`, and surfaced as
  `total_skipped_aft_filtered` in the CI `validation_summary.json`.
- **1,122 non-AFT skips** — entire test groups with `testType != "AFT"`
  that the AMA harness does not exercise: **Large Data Test (LDT)**
  groups (8 SHA-3 tcIds total — multi-gigabyte inputs outside the CI
  harness scope), **Variable Output Test (VOT)** groups (1,024
  SHAKE-128/256 tcIds — output-length coverage is already exercised by
  AFT vectors in the same upstream vector files), and the
  **ML-KEM-1024 EncapDecap** groups (90 tcIds — the encapsulation
  randomness parameter `m` is not exposed by the AMA API, so these
  groups are skipped wholesale rather than filtered within an AFT
  group). MCT groups for the four SHA-3 algorithms are no longer counted
  here; they moved from "skipped" to "tested" when MCT coverage was added
  on the 2.1.5 line. Tracked per-algorithm in
  `nist_vectors/run_vectors.py` under the legacy field name
  `mct_skipped` (now a semantic misnomer — the field counts non-AFT
  groups generally); surfaced as `total_non_aft_skipped` in
  `validation_summary.json`. (An earlier revision placed the 90 ML-KEM
  EncapDecap groups in the AFT-filtered bucket, giving a 4,757 / 1,032
  split; the harness counts them as non-AFT, so the corrected split is
  4,667 / 1,122 — the 5,789 total is unchanged. Re-derived by running the
  harness at the release head.)

The total (5,789) and the split match
[`docs/compliance/acvp_attestation.json`](acvp_attestation.json) fields
`total_vectors_skipped`, `total_vectors_skipped_aft_filtered`, and
`total_vectors_skipped_non_aft`. Skip rationale is documented in §4.

## 4. Vector Selection Criteria

From [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md` §1.4](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md):

1. **AFT + SHA-3 MCT.** Algorithm Functional Test (AFT) vectors are run for
   every covered algorithm. Monte Carlo Test (MCT) vectors are run for
   SHA3-256, SHA3-512, SHAKE-128, and SHAKE-256 via `_run_sha3_mct` /
   `_run_shake_mct` against the one-shot C API (sufficient because
   FIPS-202 MCT feeds each inner iteration's digest back as the next
   iteration's full input rather than accumulating state across
   iterations). Large Data Test (LDT) groups remain skipped — they
   require multi-gigabyte inputs outside the CI scope — and Variable
   Output Test (VOT) groups remain skipped because their output-length
   coverage is already exercised by AFT vectors in the same upstream
   vector files.
2. **Byte-aligned only.** Vectors with `bitLength % 8 != 0` are skipped —
   the AMA C API is byte-granularity only.
3. **ML-KEM-1024 only.** ML-KEM-512 and ML-KEM-768 parameter sets are not
   implemented.
4. **ML-KEM EncapDecap: decapsulation only.** The library does not expose the
   randomness parameter `m` required for deterministic encapsulation under AFT.
5. **ML-DSA-65 SigVer: external/pure (TG 3) only.** Internal and pre-hash
   test groups are skipped.
6. **SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f SigVer: external/pure (TG 5) only.** Other parameter
   sets and test groups are skipped.

## 5. Reproduction Instructions

From [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md` Appendix B](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md).

### 5.1 Build

```bash
cmake -B build -DAMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=ON
cmake --build build
```

### 5.2 Fetch ACVP Vectors

```bash
python3 nist_vectors/fetch_vectors.py
```

This pulls `internalProjection.json` files from the upstream
`usnistgov/ACVP-Server` repository. SHA-256 and AES-256-GCM vectors are
hardcoded from their respective FIPS/SP publications.

### 5.3 Run Validation

```bash
python3 nist_vectors/run_vectors.py
```

Results are written to `nist_vectors/results.json`. The harness exits non-zero
if any vector fails.

### 5.4 Continuous Validation

Continuous validation runs on every push to `main` and on a weekly schedule
via [`.github/workflows/acvp_validation.yml`](../../.github/workflows/acvp_validation.yml).
The workflow parses `results.json` and enforces three conditions:

1. **Floor:** `total_tested >= EXPECTED_VECTORS` (currently 1,215 after
   the SHA-3 MCT addition on the 2.1.5 line: 815 AFT + 400 MCT).
   Coverage can expand above this floor; it cannot drop below it.
2. **Zero failures:** `total_failed == 0`, and no algorithm may report a
   non-zero `fail_count` or a `vectors_tested == 0`.
3. **Attestation cross-check:** `docs/compliance/acvp_attestation.json`
   totals and per-algorithm `vectors_tested`/`vectors_passed` must match
   `nist_vectors/results.json` exactly. Expanding coverage therefore
   requires updating the attestation JSON and the `EXPECTED_VECTORS`
   floor in the same commit — the published attestation and the CI
   measurement move together.

A `nist_vectors/validation_summary.json` artifact is published on every
run with timestamp, git SHA, `acvp_ref`, per-algorithm counts, and split
skip accounting (`total_skipped_aft_filtered` vs `total_non_aft_skipped`).

## 6. Remediation History

The following issues were identified during validation and have been
resolved. All 1,215/1,215 vectors pass after remediation (the bullets
below predate the SHA-3 MCT expansion — the underlying 815 AFT vectors
also still pass, and the added 400 MCT vectors are a superset of the
original attestation scope).

### 6.1 ML-DSA-65 SigVer — external/pure wrapper (now 15/15)

From [§2.2 of the source report](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md). Added
`ama_dilithium_verify_ctx()` implementing the FIPS 204 §5.4
external/pure domain-separation transform
`M' = 0x00 || len(ctx) || ctx || M` before delegating to the internal
verify. Previously failed tcId 31, 35, 37 (non-empty context strings);
now all 15 TG 3 vectors pass.

### 6.2 SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f — FIPS 205 hash alignment (now 14/14)

From [§2.3 of the source report](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md). Four
deviations from FIPS 205 §11.2 were corrected in `src/c/ama_slhdsa.c`:

- `H_msg`, `H`, and `T_l` now use SHA-512 with `toByte(0, 128-n)` padding
  for security category 5 (previously SHA-256).
- ADRSc compression fixed to use the FIPS 205 32-byte ADRS byte layout
  (12-byte tree-address field) instead of the internal `uint32_t[8]` layout.
- Keypair address preserved through FORS and WOTS+ pk-compression
  operations (was prematurely zeroed by `setType` calls).

### 6.3 PRF_msg corrected to HMAC-SHA-512

From [§2.4 of the source report](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md). FIPS 205
§11.2 Table 5 requires HMAC-SHA-512 for PRF_msg in category 5, truncated
to `n` bytes. Implemented `ama_hmac_sha512_3()` (FIPS 198-1 compliant)
in `src/c/internal/ama_sha2.h` (static-linkage helper) with two
fail-closed early-return paths: `-2` on `size_t` overflow of the input
lengths (guard at `ama_sha2.h:199–205`) and `-1` on `calloc` allocation
failure (`ama_sha2.h:207–212`). Both paths zero `k_pad` and the
derived key hash via `ama_secure_memzero()` before returning.
Public-API callers map the raw return:

- `ama_hkdf.c:54–57` — `ama_hmac_sha512()` maps `-2 → AMA_ERROR_OVERFLOW`
  and any other non-zero → `AMA_ERROR_MEMORY`.
- `ama_slhdsa.c` `sha2_PRF_msg()` wraps
  `ama_hmac_sha512_3()` and propagates any non-zero return as
  `AMA_ERROR_MEMORY` upward, so signing fails fail-closed rather than
  emitting a signature with zeroed or corrupted randomness.

### 6.4 SHA-512 duplication eliminated

From [§2.5 of the source report](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md). The two
identical SHA-512 copies in the SLH-DSA signer (`ama_slhdsa.c`) and
`ama_ed25519.c` were extracted to the header-only
`src/c/internal/ama_sha2.h` with static
linkage. Zero external dependencies maintained.

### 6.5 Native HMAC-SHA3-256 promoted to public API

From [§2.7 of the source report](CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md). The
internal `hmac_sha3_256()` in `src/c/ama_hkdf.c` was promoted to
`ama_hmac_sha3_256()` with `AMA_API` export, replacing the pure-Python
RFC 2104 stopgap introduced to resolve an `import hmac` INVARIANT-1
violation. Key material is scrubbed via `ama_secure_memzero()` on all
paths including OOM.
