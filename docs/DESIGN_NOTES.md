## Scope

This document provides written security arguments for the original
(non-standardized) constructions in AMA Cryptography. Individual cryptographic
primitives (SHA3-256, Ed25519, ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-1024, SPHINCS+-SHA2-256f,
AES-256-GCM, HKDF-SHA3-256, etc.) rely on published security proofs from their
respective standards (NIST FIPS 202/203/204/205, RFC 2104/5869/7748/8032). This
document covers the *composition protocol* — how those primitives are combined —
and the two original subsystems:

1. **Double-Helix Evolution Engine** (`ama_cryptography/double_helix_engine.py`)
2. **Adaptive Cryptographic Posture System** (`ama_cryptography/adaptive_posture.py`)

Nothing in this document substitutes for independent cryptographic review.
Readers considering deployment in high-security or regulated environments
should commission an external audit by qualified cryptographers.

## 1. Double-Helix Evolution Engine

### 1.1 Purpose and Non-Cryptographic Status

The Double-Helix Evolution Engine is explicitly a **non-cryptographic** module
that provides mathematical modeling and analytical utilities for the 3R
monitoring subsystem. It implements state evolution, convergence, and
constraint-satisfaction algorithms inspired by biological and physical systems.

This is stated normatively in the module docstring
(`ama_cryptography/double_helix_engine.py` lines 20–33):

> **IMPORTANT: NON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE** […] It is NOT a cryptographic
> primitive and should NOT be relied upon for security guarantees.

The engine's outputs feed the Adaptive Cryptographic Posture System as one
signal source among several; it does not itself make cryptographic decisions,
derive keys, or touch secret material.

### 1.2 Security Boundary

The engine operates exclusively on **non-secret** monitoring metrics (anomaly
scores, Lyapunov values, ethical-constraint satisfaction indicators). It does
not:

- Accept, store, or process private-key material.
- Derive keys, MAC tags, signatures, or any secret-dependent output.
- Participate in the cryptographic critical path for encryption, signing,
  verification, or key exchange.

Consequently the engine sits **outside** the library's confidentiality and
integrity trust boundary. A fault in the engine cannot directly leak or
weaken cryptographic keys.

### 1.3 Failure Modes

Possible failure modes and their blast radius:

| Failure | Direct Effect | Blast Radius |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Numerical instability / NaN propagation | Invalid score returned to posture system | Availability only — invalid values may propagate into posture evaluation and disrupt monitoring-driven posture updates unless handled by the caller |
| Incorrect score (too high) | Spurious escalation signal | Unnecessary key rotation / algorithm switch (availability / operational cost) |
| Incorrect score (too low) | Missed escalation signal | Delayed response to a *monitoring* anomaly; no reduction in baseline cryptographic strength |
| Exception during evaluation | Exception propagates out of posture evaluation | Availability only — may interrupt the evaluation loop rather than logging and continuing; callers should wrap in their own fault handler |

Crucially, none of these failures can weaken the confidentiality or integrity
of cryptographic operations performed by `crypto_api.py`, because those
operations do not depend on the engine's output for their security.

### 1.4 Assumptions

The engine's correctness properties hold under the following assumptions:

1. Monitoring signals (loss, gradient norms, anomaly counts) are produced by
   the 3R subsystem, not attacker-controlled inputs.
2. The engine runs in the same trust domain as the monitoring subsystem;
   process-boundary attacks (RCE, container escape) are out of scope and are
   handled by OS-level controls.
3. Numeric inputs are within the documented ranges; out-of-range inputs are
   clamped by `_numeric.clip` before evaluation.
4. The engine is *not* a source of truth for cryptographic policy — it is
   advisory. The posture controller applies its own safeguards (cooldowns,
   confirmation mode) before acting.

### 1.5 Limitations

- The engine has not undergone independent formal verification or peer review.
- The mathematical model is heuristic; it produces plausibility scores, not
  cryptographic proofs.
- Adding new signal sources requires re-evaluating whether the new sources
  remain outside the secret-data trust boundary.

## 2. Adaptive Cryptographic Posture System

### 2.1 Purpose

The Adaptive Cryptographic Posture System consumes 3R monitor output and
the Double-Helix Engine's analytical signals and maps them to one of four
threat levels (`NOMINAL`, `ELEVATED`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`). Each threat level
is bound to a concrete action selected from a fixed enumeration:
`NONE`, `INCREASE_MONITORING`, `ROTATE_KEYS`, `SWITCH_ALGORITHM`,
`ROTATE_AND_SWITCH`.

No new cryptographic logic is introduced. All actions delegate to existing,
standards-based primitives via `crypto_api.py` (algorithm selection) and
`key_management.py` (BIP32 derivation, key rotation manager).

### 2.2 Security Argument

The posture system is designed so that its behavior is **monotonic with
respect to cryptographic strength**:

1. **Escalation by default; downgrade requires explicit acknowledgement.**
   The `PostureAction` enumeration contains no automatic "downgrade"
   operation. The system cannot autonomously move from a post-quantum
   algorithm to a classical one, or drop a cryptographic layer, or shorten a
   key. Algorithm switches select from a policy-defined set of
   equal-or-stronger primitives. A human-in-the-loop de-escalation path
   exists via `CryptoPostureController.acknowledge_downgrade(reason)`, which
   resets `_highest_algorithm_reached` to the current algorithm strength and
   logs the reason for audit. Downgrades therefore require an operator
   action; they never happen as an automatic response to monitoring signals.
2. **Delegated security.** Every action invokes a vetted primitive
   (Ed25519, ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-1024, HKDF-SHA3-256, AES-256-GCM, etc.). The
   posture system's security therefore reduces to the security of those
   primitives plus the correctness of the orchestration logic.
3. **Rate limiting via cooldowns.** `CryptoPostureController` enforces a
   cooldown between consecutive destructive actions (key rotation, algorithm
   switch), preventing a signal storm from degrading availability through
   unbounded rotation.
4. **Optional confirmation mode.** Destructive actions may be queued as
   `PendingAction` objects requiring explicit operator acknowledgement,
   providing a human-in-the-loop checkpoint in high-assurance deployments.
5. **Bounded operational state only.** `PostureEvaluator` retains limited
   cross-call state — an exponentially decayed `_accumulated_score` and a
   `_consecutive_counts` tally per threat level — used to debounce noisy
   inputs and prevent oscillation near decision thresholds. This state is
   bounded in size, decays over time, contains no secrets or key material,
   and does not create unbounded mutable state an attacker could poison
   indefinitely. At worst, sustained signal manipulation can influence
   posture transitions within the threat boundaries described in §2.3.

### 2.3 Threat Boundaries

The posture system's threat model assumes monitoring signals may, in the
worst case, be **influenced but not arbitrarily forged** by an attacker.
Under signal injection:

| Attacker Capability | Worst-Case Consequence | Classification |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Inject false-positive anomalies | Unnecessary `ROTATE_KEYS` / `SWITCH_ALGORITHM` | Availability / operational cost |
| Suppress true-positive anomalies | Delayed escalation; baseline cryptography remains in force | Reduced defence-in-depth, not broken crypto |
| Modulate signals near threshold | Toggle posture between `NOMINAL` and `ELEVATED` | Availability; mitigated by cooldown |
| Influence algorithm selection within policy set | Constrained to the policy-defined equal-or-stronger set | No weakening of baseline strength |

**Confidentiality and integrity of data protected by `crypto_api.py` are not
affected** by any of the above, because the posture system's action set
cannot downgrade cryptographic parameters below the baseline configured at
initialization.

### 2.4 Limitations

- The system has not undergone independent formal verification. It is a
  heuristic response layer, not a provably secure protocol.
- The posture state machine is specified in code, not in a formal
  specification language.
- Signal-to-threat-level mapping is based on engineering judgment informed
  by the 3R monitoring design; thresholds are tunable and should be
  calibrated to the deployment environment.

## 3. Composition Protocol (Multi-Layer Defense)

### 3.1 Security Argument

The library applies four independent cryptographic operations to each
protected package:

1. **SHA3-256** content hashing (FIPS 202)
2. **HMAC-SHA3-256** authentication (RFC 2104)
3. **Ed25519** classical signature (RFC 8032)
4. **ML-DSA-65** post-quantum signature (FIPS 204)

Plus a supporting operation: HKDF-SHA3-256 key derivation (RFC 5869).

The optional RFC 3161 timestamp is deliberately **excluded** from the security
argument below. AMA verifies the §2.4.2 message-imprint binding and no TSA
signature, so the token carries no adversarial resistance and must not appear
in a bound (INVARIANT-37).

The overall security argument is:

- **Bound.** Classical security is bounded below by the weakest primitive
  (approximately 2^128 via SHA3-256 / HMAC / HKDF). Quantum security is
  bounded below by 2^128 via Grover-resistant primitives; Ed25519 is
  quantum-vulnerable but is backed by ML-DSA-65.
- **Defence-in-depth.** Compromise of one primitive does not assist attack on
  another because each primitive uses an independently derived key and
  operates on an independently bound input transcript.
- **Forgery resistance.** Producing a forgery requires simultaneous breaks of
  both signature layers (Ed25519 *and* ML-DSA-65), under distinct hardness
  assumptions (elliptic-curve discrete log *and* module-lattice MLWE/MSIS).

### 3.2 Key Independence

All layer keys are derived from a master secret via HKDF-SHA3-256 using
distinct `info` strings for domain separation (RFC 5869 §3.3). Per RFC 5869
§3, when `info` strings are distinct, derived keys are cryptographically
independent under the assumption that HKDF's underlying PRF, here
HMAC-SHA3-256, behaves as a PRF.

Domain-separation strings are fixed, versioned, and length-prefixed per the
v2.1.5 security audit (see commit `b700050`, "Security audit fixes:
length-prefixed encoding, constant-time ops, and validation"). This prevents
canonicalization ambiguity between keys derived under different contexts.

### 3.3 Hybrid KEM Combiner

The hybrid KEM combiner binds X25519 and ML-KEM-1024 shared secrets per
Bindel, Brendel, Fischlin, Goncalves, Stebila (2019), "Hybrid Key
Encapsulation Mechanisms and Authenticated Key Exchange." The combiner is
IND-CCA2-secure as long as **at least one** underlying KEM remains
IND-CCA2-secure, providing graceful degradation if either classical or
post-quantum assumptions fail.

### 3.4 Known Limitations

- No **formal composition proof** has been written for the specific
  multi-layer construction used here. The informal argument above is a best
  effort; it is not a substitute for a mechanized or peer-reviewed proof.
- The composition has not been independently audited.
- Side-channel resistance of the composition depends on the side-channel
  resistance of each underlying primitive implementation. Constant-time
  behaviour is validated by dudect-style testing (see
  `CONSTANT_TIME_VERIFICATION.md`).
- Users should conduct independent review before deployment in
  high-security or regulated environments.
