# Production Dependencies
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core cryptographic library (required)
cryptography>=41.0.0

# Quantum-resistant cryptography (optional but recommended for production)
# Uncomment to enable quantum-resistant signatures:
# liboqs-python>=0.8.0,<0.15.0  # Pin to avoid version mismatch warnings
# Alternative: pqcrypto>=0.1.3,<0.2.0

# IMPORTANT: Version Pinning for Quantum Libraries
# ------------------------------------------------
# liboqs-python and the underlying liboqs C library may have version mismatches
# that produce warnings. Pin versions to ensure compatibility:
#   - liboqs-python 0.8.x-0.14.x are compatible with liboqs 0.8.x-0.14.x
#   - If you see "liboqs version differs from liboqs-python version" warnings,
#     ensure both libraries are from the same minor version series
# For production, consider building liboqs-python from source with matching liboqs
