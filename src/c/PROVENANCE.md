# PQC Implementation Provenance

**Repository:** `steel-secadv-llc/ama-cryptography`
**Scope:** Native-C post-quantum primitives in `src/c/`
**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Maintainer:** Steel Security Advisors LLC

This document records, per primitive, whether the AMA Cryptography native-C
implementation was **derived from** an upstream reference (pq-crystals,
PQClean, liboqs, …) or **written from the FIPS specification directly**.
The aim is explicit provenance: readers can audit what code was copied,
what was transcribed from the standard, and where the two diverge.

It is the companion for file-level `Provenance:` comments added to
[`ama_kyber.c`](ama_kyber.c), [`ama_dilithium.c`](ama_dilithium.c), and
[`ama_slhdsa.c`](ama_slhdsa.c). When provenance claims here and in a
source file conflict, **the source file is authoritative** — this document
must be updated to match.

Every claim of "clean-room from FIPS" is backed by ACVP Known Answer Test
results published in [`../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md)
and continuously enforced in
[`.github/workflows/acvp_validation.yml`](../../.github/workflows/acvp_validation.yml).

|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| ML-KEM-1024 (FIPS 203) | `ama_kyber.c` | Written from FIPS 203 spec | None (no upstream code copied) | N/A (clean-room) | 25/25 KeyGen, 25/25 EncapDecap |

"Clean-room" means the AMA source file was written against the published
normative document (FIPS / RFC), not copied from another implementation.
It is **not** a claim of independent formal proof of correctness — that
bar is higher and is called out separately in `ARCHITECTURE.md §Design
Philosophy` and `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md §Limitations`. Clean-room means
the text of the algorithm is the only shared artifact with third-party
implementations; it does not mean the algorithm is uniquely ours.

## ML-KEM-1024 — `ama_kyber.c`

**Standard:** NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM, August 2024 final).
**Parameter set:** ML-KEM-1024 (k=4, eta1=2, eta2=2, du=11, dv=5).

**Provenance:** Written from the FIPS 203 specification directly. No
source-level code was derived from pq-crystals/kyber, PQClean, liboqs, or
any other third-party implementation. All inner procedures
(`K-PKE.KeyGen`, `K-PKE.Encrypt`, `K-PKE.Decrypt`, `ML-KEM.KeyGen`,
`ML-KEM.Encaps`, `ML-KEM.Decaps`, and the NTT / CBD / ByteEncode /
ByteDecode helpers) were implemented by transcribing the pseudocode in
FIPS 203 §5–§7 into C.

**Randomness:** FIPS 203 §3.3 requires 32 bytes of fresh entropy for the
`d` seed in KeyGen and 32 bytes for the `m` parameter in Encaps. AMA
sources both through `ama_platform_rand.c` (getrandom / arc4random /
BCryptGenRandom depending on OS). The deterministic API
`ama_kyber_keypair_from_seed(d, z, …)` used for KAT validation bypasses
the RNG as required by ACVP.

**SIMD:** The NTT in `src/c/avx2/` is hand-written x86 assembly using the
AVX2 instruction set, developed in-house. It is not derived from the
pq-crystals AVX2 implementation. Correctness is established by the same
KAT vectors used for the generic C path (the AVX2 and generic NTT must
produce byte-identical outputs to pass the full ACVP run).

**Known divergences from the FIPS 203 pseudocode:** None in the
algorithmic sense. AMA's implementation matches FIPS 203 byte-for-byte on
all 50 applicable ACVP vectors. Non-normative differences:
- Rejection sampling in `SampleNTT` is implemented with a loop counter
  bound (to avoid infinite loops on pathological RNG behavior) rather
  than relying on the unbounded FIPS 203 loop. The bound is set high
  enough that a correct RNG will never hit it (~2^-128 probability).
- Secret key serialization uses the FIPS 203 layout
  (`dk = dk_PKE || ek_PKE || H(ek_PKE) || z`); no extra fields.

**Side-channel posture:** All secret-dependent operations use the
constant-time helpers in `ama_consttime.c`. dudect regression tests are
run from `tests/c/test_dudect.c` (built with `-DAMA_ENABLE_DUDECT=ON`) and the
standalone harnesses under `tools/constant_time/`; the deterministic
instruction-count counterpart is `tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py`.

## ML-DSA-65 — `ama_dilithium.c`

**Standard:** NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA, August 2024 final).
**Parameter set:** ML-DSA-65 (k=6, l=5, η=4, τ=49, β=196, γ₁=2^19,
γ₂=(q−1)/32, ω=55).

**Provenance:** Written from the FIPS 204 specification directly. No
source-level code was derived from pq-crystals/dilithium, PQClean,
liboqs, or any other third-party implementation. All procedures
(`ML-DSA.KeyGen`, `ML-DSA.Sign_internal`, `ML-DSA.Verify_internal`,
`Power2Round`, `Decompose`, `MakeHint`, `UseHint`, sampling from η / γ₁,
and the polynomial / NTT layer) were implemented by transcribing the
pseudocode in FIPS 204 §5–§8 into C.

**Domain separation wrapper:** The external/pure signature variant
(`ama_dilithium_sign_ctx`, `ama_dilithium_verify_ctx`) applies the
FIPS 204 §5.4 transform `M' = 0x00 || len(ctx) || ctx || M` before
delegating to the internal verify. This was added to resolve the 3
initial ACVP TG 3 failures documented in
[`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.2`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md) — the internal
verify function was correct all along; only the wrapper was missing.

**Randomness:** KeyGen consumes 32 bytes through `ama_platform_rand.c`;
Sign uses the hedged-randomness mode (ξ || rnd, where rnd is fresh per
signature) per FIPS 204 §5.3. The deterministic API
`ama_dilithium_keypair_from_seed(xi, …)` bypasses the RNG for KAT
validation as required by ACVP.

**SIMD:** The NTT / invNTT in `src/c/avx2/` and `src/c/neon/` are
hand-written and were developed in-house. The SVE2 path in
`src/c/sve2/` is also in-house (no external SVE2 Dilithium
implementation was publicly available at the time of writing).

**Known divergences from the FIPS 204 pseudocode:** None in the
algorithmic sense. All 25 KeyGen and 15 SigVer TG 3 vectors pass
byte-exact. Non-normative differences:
- `Sign_internal`'s rejection-sampling loop is bounded (maximum attempts
  = 2^16); a correct implementation will never hit the bound. This
  avoids a theoretical infinite loop on broken RNG.
- Public key hash `tr = H(ρ || t₁)` is computed once at KeyGen and
  stored in the secret key bytes, matching FIPS 204 §5.1.

**Side-channel posture:** Rejection-sampling rate depends on the secret
vector `s1`, which is a published vulnerability class for Dilithium;
AMA mitigates via hedged randomness (the `rnd` byte per FIPS 204 §5.3).

## SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f — `ama_slhdsa.c` (consolidated from the former standalone SPHINCS+ signer)

**Standard:** NIST FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA, August 2024 final).
**Parameter set:** SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f (n=32, h=68, d=17, h'=4, a=9, k=35,
w=16, security category 5 — `f` = fast variant).

**Provenance:** Written from the FIPS 205 specification directly. No
source-level code was derived from sphincs/sphincsplus, PQClean,
liboqs, or any other third-party implementation. The 10 FIPS 205
algorithms (`slh_keygen`, `slh_sign`, `slh_verify`, WOTS+ 8/9/10, FORS
14/15/16/17, and the hypertree driver 11/12/13) were implemented by
transcribing FIPS 205 §9–§11 into C.

**Hash instantiation (FIPS 205 §11.2, security categories {3,5}):**
`ama_slhdsa.c` uses:
- `H_msg` = MGF1-SHA-512 (with `toByte(0, 64 − n)` padding) — full
  resolution is documented in [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.3`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md).
- `PRF_msg` = `Trunc_n(HMAC-SHA-512(SK.prf, opt_rand || M))` — see
  [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.4`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md).
- `H` and `T_l` (multi-block thash) = SHA-512 with `toByte(0, 128 − n)`.
- `F` (single-block thash) = SHA-256 with `toByte(0, 64 − n)`.

The shared SHA-512 implementation lives in `src/c/internal/ama_sha2.h`
(extracted in v3.0.0 after SLH-DSA and Ed25519 were both shipped with
redundant copies — see [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.5`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md)).

**ADRS compression:** The 22-byte compressed address used as the SHA-2
MGF1/PRF input follows the FIPS 205 §11.2 mapping (1-byte layer address
LSB, 8-byte tree address LSB, 1-byte type, 12-byte "rest" field). The
initial implementation used a different layout — see
[`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.3`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md) for the fix.

**Known divergences from the FIPS 205 pseudocode:** None in the
algorithmic sense. All 14 TG 5 SigVer vectors pass byte-exact. Non-
normative differences:
- The FORS and WOTS+ loops preserve the keypair-address field across
  `setTreeHeight` / `setTreeIndex` / `setType` calls (FIPS 205
  Algorithms 7, 16, 18). A bug that zeroed the keypair address too
  early was caught by ACVP and is documented in
  [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.3`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md).

**Side-channel posture:** SLH-DSA is by construction hash-only; there
is no secret scalar, no rejection sampling, and no number-theoretic
operation that could leak timing. The implementation is constant-time
at the hash layer (the SHA-2 core is straight-line).

## Ed25519 — `ama_ed25519.c` + `internal/ama_ed25519_ge.h`

**Provenance:** In-house, on every platform. Until the twenty-first
maintenance pass the default x86-64 build used a vendored public-domain
assembly backend selected by a CMake option; that backend, its shim and
the option were removed (see CHANGELOG), and exactly one Ed25519
implementation remains: `src/c/ama_ed25519.c` (the RFC 8032 protocol,
scalar arithmetic mod l, digit recoding and the public API) plus the
group-arithmetic template `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_ge.h`, instantiated
twice from the same source text — over radix 2^51 (fe51, the default
everywhere) and, on x86-64 GCC/Clang builds, over radix 2^64 on the
MULX+ADX kernel (`src/c/x86/ama_ed25519_fe64_mulx.c`), byte-identical
(`tests/c/test_ed25519_fe51_mulx_equiv.c`) and selectable through
`ama_ed25519_set_mulx_override(1)` but not the default because it
measured slower at the group level. It consists of:
- Radix 2^51 field arithmetic (`fe51.h`) — written from the
  [Ed25519 paper](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf) and
  the ref10 SUPERCOP reference, in-tree. MSVC builds it through a
  128-bit accumulator on `_umul128` / `__shiftright128` (x64) or
  `__umulh` (ARM64), so Windows needs no other backend.
- Fixed-base scalar multiplication via a **signed 5-bit window comb**
  over static precomputed tables — 26 tables × 16 affine Niels entries,
  derived from the RFC 8032 base point by `tools/gen_ed25519_tables.py`
  and emitted into `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_tables.h` in both radices
  (nothing transcribed from another implementation;
  `tests/test_ed25519_static_tables.py` checks the file against the
  generator and `tests/c/test_ed25519_static_tables.c` checks every entry
  against the library's own variable-base arithmetic). Constant-time
  (INVARIANT-12): fixed digit count; table selection reads every entry
  of the row and combines with masks (a 128-bit SSE2 fold in the
  template, or the 256-bit AVX2 fold in
  `src/c/avx2/ama_ed25519_select_avx2.c` dispatched on CPUID); the digit
  sign is applied by masked swap and masked negate. No lazy
  initialisation and no atomics anywhere on the path.
- Constant-time field inversion by Bernstein–Yang safegcd divsteps
  (`src/c/internal/ama_fe25519_safegcd.h`).  The algorithm is
  Bernstein–Yang (paper cited in the file); the concrete batched 62-bit
  divstep implementation follows libsecp256k1's `modinv64` reference and its
  published write-up (Pieter Wuille et al., MIT), attributed in NOTICE.  It is
  the one adapted component in this backend; everything else here is written
  from the specifications above.
- Verification by half-size scalar decomposition (Antipa et al.,
  `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_halfsize.h`) over precomputed odd
  multiples of B and of 2^128 B, with a projective identity test —
  vartime, used only where every scalar is public.

The AMA-level wrapper (`ama_ed25519.c`) adds:
- API surface matching AMA's `ama_ed25519_sign` / `_verify` contract.
- Integration with the AMA ctypes bindings and the FROST threshold layer.
- Expanded-key fast path used by `generate_ed25519_keypair` — see
  [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.8`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md).
- `ama_ed25519_scalarmult_public` with explicit naming to prevent
  misuse of vartime scalar multiplication on secret scalars (audit
  finding C7).

Equivalence between the two fixed-base paths (comb vs. the wNAF
variable-base reference) is continuously verified by
`tests/c/test_ed25519_comb_equiv.c` on 1024 clamped random scalars,
256 unclamped random scalars, plus seven edge-case vectors (identity,
scalar=1, all-nibbles-+7, all-nibbles-+8, alternating bytes,
non-clamped all-0xFF, non-clamped top-byte 0xFE).  The last two
provably exceed the group order l and exercise the internal
`sc25519_reduce` path specifically.

**Formerly vendored code.** Earlier revisions of this section carried a
table of `AMA-PATCH:` fixes applied on top of the vendored x86-64 backend
(an unaligned-load fix in its point decoding and a zero-length `memcpy`
guard in its hash update). That backend was removed in the twenty-first
maintenance pass (see CHANGELOG), so no patched third-party source remains
in the tree. The regression test the first fix introduced,
`tests/c/test_ed25519_unaligned_input.c`, stays in the suite and runs
against the in-house implementation, and the removed backend's recorded
behaviour is pinned by `tests/oracle/ed25519_frozen_oracle.txt` (2,022
records taken at commit `e848740`, replayed by
`tests/c/test_ed25519_frozen_oracle.c` and
`tests/test_ed25519_frozen_oracle.py`).

No AES-NI-like hardware instructions exist for Ed25519; all speedups
are algorithmic (precomputed tables, Karatsuba / fe51 field layout,
signed-digit comb).

## Clean-room statement

For the three PQC primitives (`ama_kyber.c`, `ama_dilithium.c`,
`ama_slhdsa.c`), the maintainer (Andrew E. A., Steel Security Advisors
LLC) attests that:

1. The C source was written directly against the FIPS 203 / 204 / 205
   specification text.
2. Neither pq-crystals, PQClean, liboqs, nor any other third-party
   PQC source tree was used as a copy source during development. Such
   trees were consulted at the specification layer only (to understand
   ambiguous FIPS wording) and never at the code layer.
3. Algorithmic correctness is validated by the ACVP vectors in
   [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md). A clean-room
   implementation that matches byte-for-byte against the upstream KAT
   vectors is — by definition — interoperable with any conformant
   implementation.

This attestation does **not** claim:
- Formal proof of correctness. See `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md §Limitations`.
- Immunity from implementation bugs. Two such bugs have already been
  found and fixed (the SLH-DSA hash-instantiation and address-zeroing
  bugs in [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §2.3`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md)).
  Readers should expect more over the life of the project and are
  encouraged to file issues via the `SECURITY.md` disclosure process.
- FIPS 140-3 certification. See
  [`CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md §3.3`](../../docs/compliance/CSRC_ALIGN_REPORT.md).

## Why this document exists

Post-quantum cryptographic libraries ship with heavy inheritance:
liboqs, AWS-LC, BoringSSL, OpenSSL 3.5+, and CIRCL all derive from
pq-crystals or PQClean and say so explicitly in their source trees.
Without a comparable provenance statement, readers of AMA Cryptography
have no way to tell whether the PQC code is a clean-room FIPS transcription,
a PQClean fork with the identifiers renamed, or something in between.

The file-level `Provenance:` comments in the three PQC sources plus
this document make the answer auditable: everything in `ama_kyber.c`,
`ama_dilithium.c`, and `ama_slhdsa.c` was written here, against the
NIST standards, and is held to the same ACVP bar any FIPS-aspiring
implementation must clear.
