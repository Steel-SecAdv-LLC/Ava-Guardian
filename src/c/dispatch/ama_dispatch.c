 * regardless of _POSIX_C_SOURCE level — but on Apple's libc, defining
 * _POSIX_C_SOURCE at any level (including 199309L) switches
 * <stdio.h> into strict POSIX mode, which hides snprintf below
 * _POSIX_C_SOURCE = 200112L (the level POSIX.1-2001 incorporated the
 * C99 stdio additions).  Apple Clang's default
 * `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration` then fails the build at the
 * snprintf call in `print_dispatch_info` below.  200809L exposes both
 * clock_gettime and snprintf on every supported libc (glibc, musl,
 * Apple libc, BSD libc), and matches the version the rest of the C

 * It scrubs every kernel pointer back to its scalar fallback EXCEPT

 * SIMD kernel for the dudect per-slot timing sweep so the t-value is
 * attributable to that kernel alone (rather than to whichever AVX2
 * paths happened to fire under the same dispatch invocation).
 *
 * Recognition strategy: compare the wired function pointer in
 * `saved` against the architecture-specific kernel symbol.  A
 * mismatch (the wired pointer is generic, a different SIMD tier, or
 * NULL) means the host does not satisfy the requested slot — return
 * AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY_UNSUPPORTED so the caller emits a clear error
 * and leaves the dispatch_table at scalar fallback.  An unknown
 * slot name returns AMA_DISPATCH_ONLY_UNRECOGNISED.  Either way the
 * test harness in tests/c/test_dispatch_only_env.c surfaces that
 * state as a CTest skip (exit 77) via the `"all-default-dispatch"`
 * sentinel from ama_dispatch_active_slot().
 *
 * The function itself emits NO stderr — every diagnostic is the
 * caller's responsibility.  This is deliberate (Copilot review #323
 * follow-up): when apply_dispatch_only() ALSO printed a stderr line
 * for the unrecognised-slot branch, the caller's own diagnostic
 * doubled it for that case while leaving the unsupported-slot case
 * silent under the verbose gate.  The status-enum return restores

     *     never match and the slot would answer UNSUPPORTED — with a
     *     diagnostic blaming the CPU or the build, both false.  That is
     *     exactly the defect recorded above this line for `sha3-neon`, and
     *     the SVE2 configuration is where pinning the NEON tier is *most*
     *     useful, since it is the only way to A/B the two tiers on one host.
     *   - `argon2_g` is left NULL when `AMA_DISPATCH_NO_ARGON2_AVX2=1` is set,
     *     and any of the three may be demoted by the auto-tune microbench on
     *     a noisy host.  A pin exists precisely to override the default
     *     selection, so neither is a reason to refuse it.
     *
     * AdvSIMD is architecturally mandatory on AArch64 (`ama_has_arm_neon()`
     * always returns 1 there) and these kernels are compiled whenever this
     * branch is, so the check is the honest one: the kernel exists, wire it.

/* ===== Cross-process auto-tune cache =====================================
 *
 * Opt-in via `AMA_DISPATCH_CACHE_FILE=<path>`.  When set:
 *   - Load:  if <path> exists and the cached `fingerprint=` line matches
 *            the current host's fingerprint, populate the verdict
 *            struct from the file and skip the microbench entirely.
 *   - Save:  after a successful microbench, write the verdict struct
 *            to <path> using a tmp-file + rename for atomicity.
 *
 * Security model — the env var is honoured ONLY for non-tainted
 * processes (see dispatch_cache_env_is_safe).  When a setuid / setgid
 * binary launches with `AMA_DISPATCH_CACHE_FILE` set, the env var is
 * ignored entirely (no read, no write) so a lower-privileged caller
 * cannot point a privileged process at an attacker-controlled path.
 * The cache file is created with mode 0600 (user-only read/write) via
 * `open(O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_CLOEXEC, 0600)` + `fdopen` to close
 * the default-umask 0666 risk that `fopen("we")` would otherwise leave
 * on a host with `umask 0`.
 *
 * The fingerprint is a deterministic string built from arch_name +
 * per-slot impl level (so a dispatch-wiring change invalidates the
 * cache even when the underlying CPU features are unchanged) + the
 * runtime CPU feature probes already exposed by ama_cpuid.h.  Any
 * change to the host CPU's detected features (kernel upgrade,
 * microcode change, hypervisor masking) or to the per-slot wiring
 * (library upgrade) invalidates the cache automatically — no manual
 * flush.
 *
 * Format (text, one key=value per line, leading `#` are comments):
 *
 *     # AMA Cryptography dispatch auto-tune cache v2
 *     fingerprint=<deterministic-string>
 *     keccak_regressed=<0|1>
 *     keccak_fallback_regressed=<0|1>
 *     keccak_x4_regressed=<0|1>
 *     kyber_ntt_regressed=<0|1>
 *     kyber_invntt_regressed=<0|1>
 *     dilithium_ntt_regressed=<0|1>
 *     dilithium_invntt_regressed=<0|1>
 *     keccak_simd_ns=<int64>
 *     keccak_generic_ns=<int64>
 *     ...
 *
 * The verdict timings are written for diagnostic value AND parsed on
 * load so a verbose cache-hit log shows the cached `simd / generic`
 * ns readings instead of zeros.  Only the per-slot `regressed` flags
 * drive kernel revert decisions either way.  Unknown lines are skipped
 * so old binaries reading a newer cache file degrade gracefully.
 *
 * The fingerprint check is a strict string equality — if any feature
 * differs between the cached header and the current host, the cache
 * is treated as a miss and the bench runs.  This is the conservative
 * choice: a false-positive cache hit could install a regressed kernel
 * pointer that the bench would have caught.
 */

/* Returns 1 iff the current process is "safe" to honour the
 * AMA_DISPATCH_CACHE_FILE env var.  A setuid / setgid process must
 * NOT trust environment-controlled paths — opening or writing an
 * attacker-controlled file under elevated privileges is the canonical
 * setuid env-var escalation primitive.
 *
 * - issetugid()        — BSD / Apple / musl, returns 1 if the process
 *                        was started setuid/setgid OR if the auxiliary
 *                        vector indicates a tainted exec.  Strictly
 *                        the right gate where available.
 * - getauxval(AT_SECURE) — glibc fallback that mirrors the same
 *                        secure-exec bit the dynamic linker uses to
 *                        scrub LD_LIBRARY_PATH; 1 iff the kernel
 *                        marked the exec as secure.
 * - getuid()/geteuid() comparison — last-resort fallback for libcs
 *                        that expose neither of the above.  Same
 *                        check for the gid pair.
 *
 * On platforms exposing none of these the gate degrades open.  Windows is
 * not one of those platforms, it is no platform at all here: this whole
 * function sits inside the `#if !defined(_WIN32)` region opened above and
 * closed by the `#else` stub near the end of the file, so it does not exist
 * in a Windows build.  It used to open with `#if defined(_WIN32) return 1;`,
 * which no configuration could ever select, and the paragraph above said
 * "MSVC builds" while that guard said Windows.  Both are gone; the arms
 * below are the only ones that were ever reachable. */

     *   len=4096   ama_sha3_256  7967.3 ns   ama_sha3_256_avx2  37239.8 ns
     *
     * 4.4x-4.7x SLOWER -- and the reason is NOT what this note first said.
     * It claimed the wrappers "duplicate the same scalar absorb and then
     * drive a permutation built for 4-way batching down a single lane".
     * Both halves were wrong: `ama_sha3_256_avx2` called
     * `ama_keccak_f1600_avx2`, the SINGLE-state permutation, and never
     * referenced the 4-way `ama_keccak_f1600_x4_avx2`; and the absorb is not
     * duplicated work either, since the public `ama_sha3_256` performs the
     * identical scalar 17-lane XOR.
     *
     * The whole gap is the Phase-3 auto-tune.  On the measurement host it
     * reverts `dispatch_table.keccak_f1600` OFF the AVX2 kernel, so
     * `ama_sha3_256` ran the fast scalar/BMI baseline while the wrapper --
     * which hard-linked `ama_keccak_f1600_avx2` -- did not.  Measured here
     * with AMA_DISPATCH_VERBOSE=1:
     *
     *   Auto-tune verdicts (regressed=1 reverted):
     *     keccak=1 (simd=2382407 ns vs generic=496411 ns)   -> 4.80x
     *   keccak_f1600 -> scalar (BMI1/BMI2)
     *
     * and with AMA_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOTUNE=1: `keccak_f1600 -> SIMD`.  4.80x is
     * the same ratio the wrapper timings show, so the wrapper was REDUNDANT,
     * not slow: it bypassed a revert the public entry point benefits from.
     * That is a property of the AVX2 Keccak kernel, which the auto-tune
     * already handles.
     *
     * The AVX2 and NEON wrappers also disagreed with the public contract:
     * `ama_sha3_256(NULL, 0, out)` returns AMA_SUCCESS and those two returned
     * AMA_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM, so wiring them would have made a public API's
     * NULL handling depend on the host CPU -- the same class of defect as two
     * verifiers disagreeing on one signature.  Not "every wrapper": the SVE2
     * one guarded `if (!input && input_len > 0)`, byte-for-byte the public
     * rule, and accepted (NULL, 0).
     *

     *     VL=128/256/512.  AArch64 hosts continue to dispatch to the
     *     validated NEON kernel wired above.
     *   - Argon2 (`ama_argon2_sve2.c`): prior kernel implemented
     *     plain Blake2b G — not RFC 9106 §3.5 BlaMka G — and was
     *     missing the column-pass entirely.  Wiring it would have
     *     broken Argon2id KATs.  AArch64 hosts continue to dispatch
     *     to the validated NEON BlaMka kernel wired above.
     *   - SPHINCS+ / SLH-DSA (`ama_sphincs_sve2.c`): the dispatch
     *     table intentionally exposes no SPHINCS+ function-pointer
     *     slots; the SLH-DSA inner loop accelerates indirectly via
     *     the `keccak_f1600` slot above (which on SVE2 routes to the
     *     SVE2 Keccak kernel).  A standalone SLH-DSA SVE2 surface
     *     would be speculative API.
     *   - Ed25519 (`ama_ed25519_sve2.c`): the dispatcher reports
     *     `ed25519 = AMA_IMPL_GENERIC` on every AArch64 host (see
     *     lines 354-357 above).  A vector-wide Ed25519 path only
     *     pays off in a batched API which AMA Cryptography
     *     intentionally does not expose.
     *   - AES-GCM (`ama_aes_gcm_sve2.c`): PR #308 precedent.  AES-GCM
     *     on SVE2 dispatches through the NEON PMULL kernel above,
     *     which carries the ARMv8 Crypto Extensions.
