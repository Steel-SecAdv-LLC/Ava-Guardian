 * @brief AES-NI/PCLMULQDQ AES-256-GCM with pipelined rounds and GHASH
 *        (lives in the avx2/ tree for historical layout; needs no AVX2)
 *
 * Enhances the existing AES-NI path with:
 *   - Pipelined AES-NI rounds (process 8 blocks simultaneously)
 *   - Vectorized GHASH using PCLMULQDQ with Karatsuba multiplication
 *   - Interleaved AES-CTR + GHASH for maximum throughput
 *
 * Requires: AES-NI + PCLMULQDQ + SSSE3 (pshufb, for the GCM<->PCLMULQDQ
 * byte-swap below).  Built with -maes -mpclmul -mssse3 -msse4.1.  It does
 * NOT require AVX2 — no 256- or 512-bit (_mm256_ / _mm512_) intrinsic appears
 * here, so the dispatcher installs it on any AES-NI + PCLMULQDQ host, with or
 * without AVX2 (see src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c).

 *
 * (The previous revision crossed the boundary three times per block:
 * both operands in, the result out.  Those VPSHUFBs contend for the
 * same execution port as the carry-less multiplies themselves.)
 *
 * Reduction is modulo the reflected GCM polynomial
 * x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1, by the two-phase shift-and-XOR
