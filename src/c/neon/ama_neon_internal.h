 * @file ama_neon_internal.h
 * @brief Internal prototypes for the hand-written AArch64 NEON SIMD kernels.
 *
 * This header is PRIVATE to src/c/neon/, to the dispatch layer and to the
 * C tests that pin individual kernels.  It is NOT installed and is never
 * exposed to library consumers; every symbol declared here is a
 * runtime-dispatch implementation detail.
 *
 * It is the NEON counterpart of src/c/avx2/ama_avx2_internal.h and exists
 * for the same two reasons.
 *
 * 1. `-Wmissing-prototypes` is a project-wide flag (CMakeLists.txt) and
 *    `-Werror=missing-prototypes` in the strict-warnings gate.  Every NEON
 *    entry point was defined without a prior declaration, so each one
 *    produced a warning at its definition — 25 of them across the eight
 *    files here.  None was ever reported, because the strict-warnings gate
 *    runs on x86-64 only, where these translation units compile to an empty
 *    `#else` typedef.  The gate's claim ("no warnings beyond the two
 *    documented extension classes") was true of the one
 *    architecture it built, and the AArch64 build it never ran was carrying
 *    the exact class the gate makes fatal.
 *
 * 2. The prototypes were being re-transcribed by hand at each consumer:
 *    `src/c/dispatch/ama_dispatch.c` declared its own `extern` block,
 *    `src/c/ama_sha256.c` declared `ama_sha256_compress_neon` again, and
 *    `tests/c/test_sha256_neon_kat.c` a third time.  These are raw
 *    `uint8_t[]` / `uint32_t[]` buffer signatures whose addresses are then
 *    stored in a dispatch table: a signature that drifts between the
 *    definition and one of its transcriptions is not a compile error, it is
 *    undefined behaviour at the indirect call.  One declaration, included by
 *    both the definition and every consumer, makes that drift impossible.
 *
 * Symbols with no in-tree caller today are declared here too rather than
 * being made `static`: they are dispatch-graph material kept in-tree (the
 * lane-local add/sub/carry/compress routines), and turning them static
 * would remove symbols from the shipped shared library — an ABI change made
 * for a lint's convenience.  Declaring them is the fix for the missing
 * prototype; whether to wire them into dispatch is a separate question.

 * that serialized its keystream host-order (silently wrong ciphertext on
 * aarch64_be for every message >= 512 bytes; fixed since, but never
 * validated on big-endian hardware: no CI lane builds aarch64_be).  A
 * kernel tier whose correctness on an ordering has never been executed
 * does not get installed on that ordering.  -DAMA_ENABLE_NEON=OFF is the
 * escape hatch that is actually correct: it removes the tier entirely and
