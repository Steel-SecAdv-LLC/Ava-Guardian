 * @file ama_testing_exports.h
 * @brief Declarations for symbols exported only under AMA_TESTING_MODE.
 *
 * WHY THIS HEADER EXISTS
 *
 * Several primitives expose an internal routine to the C test suite so a
 * property can be isolated from the public entry point that wraps it — the
 * constant-time scalar negate in FROST, the Kyber NTT and CPA round-trips.
 * These are deliberately absent from every public header: they are not ABI,
 * and `AMA_TESTING_MODE` is what admits them.
 *
 * "Absent from every public header" had become "absent from every header",
 * which is a different thing.  Each definition sat with no prototype in
 * scope, and each consumer carried its own `extern` — `ama_frost.c`'s
 * `scalar_negate` export is declared separately in `tests/c/test_frost.c` and
 * again in `tests/c/test_dudect.c`, the Kyber pair again in
 * `tests/c/test_kyber_cpa.c`.  Nothing connected the transcriptions, so a
 * signature change would have produced a silent ABI mismatch rather than a
 * compile error, on functions whose arguments are raw `uint8_t[32]` buffers.
 *
 * `-Wmissing-prototypes` reported it and nothing acted on the report, because
 * the CI job named "Strict Compiler Warnings (Werror)" did not pass
 * `-Werror`.  One declaration, included by the definition and by every
 * consumer, restores the check the compiler was already willing to do.
 *
 * The declarations are deliberately NOT wrapped in `#ifdef AMA_TESTING_MODE`.
 * CMake sets that macro `PRIVATE` on the `ama_cryptography_test` library
 * target, so the test executables that *link* it do not carry it — a guarded
 * header would therefore vanish exactly where it is included, and the callers
 * would fall back to implicit declarations. gcc accepts those silently; clang
 * 16+ rejects them, which is how this was caught.
 *
 * Declaring a symbol that a given configuration does not define is harmless:
 * the failure surfaces at link time, loudly, in the one configuration that
 * calls it. That is the correct failure mode, and strictly better than the
 * unchecked `extern` this header replaces.

 * Setting `blocks` to 1 makes the first window 112 candidates, so EVERY seed

 * asserts the resulting matrix is byte-identical to the one the full window
 * produces.  Values of 0 or > 4 reset to the shipped default rather than

 * less.  Defined only under AMA_TESTING_MODE, so no production build carries

/**
 * Report whether the library was built with compiler optimization enabled.
 *
 * @return 1 optimized (`__OPTIMIZE__`), 0 unoptimized, -1 toolchain cannot say.
 *
 * WHY A CRYPTOGRAPHIC LIBRARY EXPORTS ITS OWN OPTIMIZATION LEVEL
 *
 * The instruction-count constant-time gates in `tools/` exist to catch a
 * defect the OPTIMIZER introduces: a mask the compiler can prove is 0 or ~0
 * licenses it to replace a branch-free select with a branch on the secret
 * predicate (see internal/ama_ct_barrier.h).  Compiled without optimization
 * that transformation cannot happen at all, so the gate measures a program in
 * which its own defect class is unreachable — and reports PASS.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical.  `dudect.yml` configured its library with
 * `cmake -B build -DAMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=ON -DAMA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
 * -DAMA_ENABLE_LTO=OFF` and no `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, which in this project
 * yields `C_FLAGS` with no `-O` flag whatsoever.  Every instruction-count
 * target ran against that build.  Re-run at `-O3`, the same `--target ecdsa`
 * check that had been passing measured a 9,424-instruction key-dependent
 * spread in `sc_mont_mul`/`sc_cond_sub_n` under clang 18 — a live Montgomery
 * extra-reduction leak on the ECDSA signing path, invisible to the gate for
 * as long as the gate built the library the way it did.
 *
 * A check cannot be trusted to be told what it is measuring, so it asks.
 * `tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py` calls this before it measures anything
 * and refuses to return a verdict (exit 2) unless the answer is 1.
 *
 * Scope: the value describes the translation unit it is compiled in.  CMake
 * applies one set of C flags to every source in the library target, so it is
 * representative of the whole archive; a hand-rolled build that optimized
 * some files and not others is out of scope and the gate would report on
 * this file's setting.

/**
 * Raw Ascon permutation, for the C KAT only.

 * The KAT drives the permutation directly so a fault in the permutation
 * cannot be cancelled by a compensating fault in the modes that wrap it.
 * Not part of the supported API surface.
 *
 * This declaration lived in `include/ama_cryptography.h` until it was moved
 * here.  The function deliberately carries no `AMA_API`, and
 * `cmake/ama_exports.map` localises it, so it is absent from the shared
 * library's dynamic symbol table (verified: `nm -D` finds nothing).  A
 * downstream consumer that included the installed public header and called
 * the function it declared therefore got an unresolved-symbol link failure
 * against `libama_cryptography.so` — a declaration promising an ABI that the
 * export map exists to withhold.  The C KAT reaches it by linking the static
 * `ama_cryptography_test` archive, which is what this header is for.

/**
 * Reset / read the largest |coefficient| observed at any ML-DSA inverse-NTT
 * entry on this thread.
 *
 * The inverse NTT does not reduce the additive half of its butterfly, so the
 * bound on the accumulating coefficient doubles at each of its 8 levels and
 * the structural worst case is 256x the input bound.  |input| < q is
 * therefore a real precondition — 256q is 0.1% under INT32_MAX — and it is a
 * precondition of the CALL SITES, which the transform cannot enforce on
 * itself.  Three sites in this file feed an l-fold accumulator (keygen, the
 * secret-key consistency check, and w = A*NTT(y) in signing), bounded by
 * nothing tighter than l*q, and each reduces first for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Dropping one of those reductions is invisible to every functional test:
 * signatures still verify and every KAT still passes, because the transform
 * is linear modulo q and the results are reduced downstream — only the
 * overflow margin changes.  This counter makes it observable, and
 * `tests/c/test_dilithium_invntt_bound.c` asserts it stays under q across
 * keygen, signing and verification.
 *
 * Thread-local, so a parallel ctest run cannot make one test observe
 * another's arithmetic.  Maintained only under `AMA_TESTING_MODE`, which
 * CMake sets PRIVATE on `ama_cryptography_test`; the shipped libraries carry
 * neither the counter nor the loop that maintains it.
 *
 * The accumulator is DISARMED until `..._reset()` is called.  The same archive
 * is linked by `tests/c/test_dudect.c`, whose `ML-DSA-65 sign` lane runs
 * through this path, and the accumulator's inner comparison branches on a
 * secret-derived magnitude; unconditional, it would put a data-dependent
 * branch inside a lane that exists to prove there is none.  A dudect binary
 * never calls `..._reset()`, so the loop never runs there.
