/* Ed25519 canonical-scalar check (RFC 8032 5.1.7) — INVARIANT-26.
 *
 * 5.1.7 step 1 requires the verifier to decode the signature's second half
 * as an integer S in the range 0 <= S < L, and to reject it otherwise.
 * Neither of the two backends the tree then carried did, so (R, S + L)
 * verified as well as (R, S) — signature malleability: a distinct 64-byte
 * string for one authenticated message, producible without the private key.
 * The since-removed vendored backend checked only `RS[63] & 224` (rejecting
 * S >= 2^253, while L sits just above 2^252, so the band where S + L lands
 * passed); the in-house backend had no check and reduces mod L internally.
 *
 * Header-only (dating from when two backend sources were swapped at
 * configure time); the predicates stay here because every decode and every
 * verify funnels through them.
 *
 * Not constant time by requirement — S arrives in the signature and is
 * public — but written branch-free anyway.

 * the opposite of the X25519 rule in RFC 7748 5, where a u in the same band
 * is reduced so two peers agree on one shared secret.  INVARIANT-27 records
 * that split and states the Ed25519 side of it explicitly; this predicate is
 * what makes the statement true of the code.  Before it, both decoders then
 * in the tree reduced mod p, so each of the 19 values in [p, 2^255) decoded
 * to the same curve point as its reduced counterpart and a public key had
 * two accepted encodings.
 *
 * This is the same input-canonicalization class as INVARIANT-26's 0 <= S < L
 * and INVARIANT-29's ECDSA Qx/Qy in [0, p), and it is resolved the same way:
 * a verification key must not admit a second byte encoding, because anything
 * that treats the key as an identity -- a fingerprint, a map key, a bytewise
 * authorisation compare -- is then looking at two names for one key.
 *
 * It is not a forgery route on its own: S < L is enforced, and a malleated R
 * is rejected by ama_ed25519_signature_r_is_canonical() below.  That last
 * clause used to read "a malleated R fails the re-encode comparison, so both
 * signature-malleability paths were already closed" -- true of the two
 * single-signature verifiers, and half false of the removed vendored
 * backend's batch path, which decoded R instead of re-encoding and so closed
 * only the S one.  The S half was already covered there by an explicit
 * canonical-S loop after the batch; nothing covered R.  The R predicate
 * exists because that half of the sentence did not hold everywhere it was
 * written.  (An earlier correction here said the batch path "closed neither", which
 * overstates in the other direction.)

 *

 * single square root, so the sign bit distinguishes nothing, and the encoding
 * with it SET is a second spelling of a point whose canonical encoding has it
 * clear.  Neither backend then in the tree implemented the rule: the
 * in-house decoder negates conditionally (and -0 == 0, so the sign bit was
 * silently ignored), and the vendored one compared parity and skipped the
 * negate for the same reason.  The identity therefore had two accepted
 * encodings.
 *
 * x = 0 exactly when y^2 = 1 — from x^2 = (y^2 - 1)/(d*y^2 + 1), the numerator
 * vanishes — i.e. y = 1 (the identity) or y = p-1 (the order-2 point).  So the
 * rule is decidable from the encoding alone, without decompressing: reject
 * when the sign bit is set and the masked y is one of those two values.  That
 * keeps this a pure byte predicate usable by both backends, exactly like the
 * y-canonicality check above.
 *
 * Neither affected point is a legitimate verification key (the identity
 * verifies nothing; the order-2 point is low-order), so this is an
 * encoding-uniqueness fix in the family of INVARIANT-26/29/38 rather than a
 * forgery route.  Public input; branch-free regardless.

 * 5.1.7 step 1 says "decode the first half as a point R", and 5.1.3 is what
 * decoding means: a y >= p fails, and x = 0 with the sign bit set fails.  So
 * the same two rules the public key is held to bind R, and for the same
 * reason: an encoding that is not the unique spelling of its point is a
 * second name for one signature.
 *
 * The single-signature verifiers satisfied this by accident rather than by
 * rule.  Both re-encode the computed [S]B - [h]A and compare bytes against
 * R, and both encoders emitted only canonical encodings, so a non-canonical
 * R could never match and was rejected.  The removed vendored backend's BATCH
 * path had no such comparison: it decoded R and checked the aggregate group
 * equation, and its decoder took `01 00..00` with bit 255 set to the identity
 * and dropped the set sign bit (x = 0 has one root, so the conditional negate
 * is a no-op).  Batch therefore reported VALID for a signature single verify
 * REJECTS -- two verifiers in one library disagreeing on one input, which is
 * the condition INVARIANT-26/38 exist to forbid.
 *
 * That divergence was reachable with the signer's own key and no forgery:
 * put R = the identity's sign-bit-set encoding, and S = h * a mod L makes
 * [S]B - [h]A the identity, which is what R decodes to.  Reproduced at
 * count >= 4 (that path fell back to per-entry verify while num <= 3), see
 * tests/c/test_ed25519_canonical_r.c.
 *
 * Applying the rule explicitly on the single-verify path -- which the batch
 * verifier calls per entry (B1, 5.0.0 pre-tag audit) --
 * puts it on every verify path by construction: the batch path no longer has a
 * separate aggregate decode of R that could disagree with single verify.  No
 * legitimate signature is affected: R is produced by the same canonical
 * encoders whose output the comparison already required. */
