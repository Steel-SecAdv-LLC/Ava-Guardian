 * @brief NIST prime curves P-256 / P-384 / P-521 — ECDSA (FIPS 186-5) and ECDH
 * @author Andrew E. A., Steel Security Advisors LLC
 * @date 2026-07-27
 *
 * Implemented from specification (SP 800-186 curve parameters, FIPS 186-5
 * ECDSA, SP 800-56A §5.7.1.2 ECC CDH, RFC 6979 deterministic nonces, SEC 1
 * point encoding).  Zero external crypto dependencies (INVARIANT-1): the only
 * primitives consumed are AMA's own HMAC-SHA-256/384/512 and the platform
 * CSPRNG.
 *
 * Why one file for three curves.  P-256, P-384 and P-521 are all short
 * Weierstrass curves `y^2 = x^3 - 3x + b` over a prime field with cofactor 1.
 * The *only* things that differ are the modulus, the group order, `b`, the
 * generator, and the operand width.  Writing three near-identical files would
 * triple the audit surface for zero capability; instead the arithmetic is
 * generic over a limb count (`nlimbs <= AMA_NISTP_MAX_LIMBS`) and the curve is
 * a `const` parameter block.  `ama_secp256k1.c` stays separate because it is a
 * different curve shape (`a = 0`, and a Solinas prime that admits a
 * curve-specific 5x52 reduction that a generic path cannot express).
 *
 * Arithmetic.  Montgomery form over 64-bit limbs with CIOS multiplication.
 * A generic Montgomery multiply is used rather than per-curve Solinas
 * reduction because the reduction chains for P-256/384/521 are three separate
 * bodies of subtle carry code; one generic, uniformly constant-time kernel is
 * the defensible engineering trade at this stage.  See the "Timing posture"
 * note below and `docs/NIST_PRIME_CURVES.md` for the measured cost.
 *
 * Security properties:
 * - Constant-time field and scalar arithmetic: no secret-dependent branch and
 *   no secret-dependent memory index anywhere on the signing / ECDH path.
 * - Scalar multiplication is a fixed 4-bit window whose table is read with a
 *   full constant-time linear scan (every entry is touched, every time).
 * - The point addition handles *all* exceptional cases (either operand at
 *   infinity, P == Q, P == -Q) branchlessly by computing the general result
 *   and the doubling and selecting between them with masks.
 * - Every secret intermediate is zeroed on every exit path (INVARIANT-6).
 * - Verification is variable time by design; every one of its inputs is
 *   public.  This matches `ama_secp256k1_ecdsa_verify` and
 *   `ama_ed25519_batch_verify`.
 *
 * Malleability posture (INVARIANT-34).  Low-`s` is a property of a
 * sign/verify *pair*, not of either half, and both halves are off by default
 * on these curves:
 *
 *   - Signing emits RFC 6979's `s` verbatim, so `ama_nistp_ecdsa_sign`
 *     reproduces the RFC's own Appendix A.2.5/A.2.6/A.2.7 vectors exactly.
 *     `AMA_NISTP_ECDSA_SIGN_LOW_S` opts in to normalisation.
 *   - Verification accepts either representative, because that is what
 *     X9.62 / FIPS 186-5 / TLS / JWS / WebAuthn / X.509 require and the entire
 *     point of these curves here is interoperating with them.
 *     `AMA_NISTP_ECDSA_REQUIRE_LOW_S` opts in to rejection.
 *
 * Normalising while verifying permissively — which this file did before —
 * prevents nothing: the twin of an AMA signature still verifies under AMA.
 * It only costs RFC 6979 conformance.  A caller who controls both ends sets
 * both flags and gets the real property.
 *
 * The checks that do *not* cost interop — minimal DER, `r, s` strictly in
 * `[1, n-1]` rather than reduced, and public-key coordinates strictly in
 * `[0, p)` — are unconditional in every mode, exactly as INVARIANT-28/29
 * require for secp256k1.

 * their shared one-shot probe, but this predicate is consulted on the order
 * of ten thousand times per verification, so it is worth collapsing to a
 * single relaxed load.
 *
 * `_Atomic int`, not a plain `int`.  An earlier revision of this comment
 * argued that "the write is idempotent ... so no synchronisation is needed
 * beyond the once-guard already inside the CPUID getters", and both halves
 * were wrong.  An idempotent value does not stop concurrent unsynchronised
 * read and write from being a data race — C11 5.1.2.4p25 makes it undefined
 * behaviour regardless of what the store does at the architecture level — and
 * the CPUID getters' once orders nothing about *this* object.  It was exactly
 * the "lockless flag + plain variable" shape that INVARIANT-15 and
 * `src/c/internal/ama_once.h` prohibit outright, in a file whose other
 * one-time state (NISTP_COMB_ONCE) already goes through AMA_CALL_ONCE.
 *
 * It was also live rather than theoretical, and its invisibility was an
 * accident of which entry point ran first: on the keygen/sign/verify paths
 * the first write happens inside `nistp_comb_build()` under NISTP_COMB_ONCE,
 * so nothing races.  `ama_nistp_point_decode` and `ama_nistp_pubkey_validate`
 * — both attacker-input paths — reach this gate through `nistp_load_point`
 * with no once in the way, and ThreadSanitizer reports the race there.
 * `tests/c/test_concurrent_init.c` drives exactly that shape from eight
 * threads released together, and is what turned the finding into a
 * reproduction.
 *
 * `memory_order_relaxed` is the correct order and is what finally makes the
 * paragraph above true: the gate publishes no other data, so no reader needs
 * to observe anything that happened before the write, and the value is
 * idempotent so a reader that misses it simply recomputes the same answer.
 * The hot path does not pay for this — on x86-64 a relaxed load of an aligned
 * int is the same instruction a plain load compiles to.
 *
 * No portability fallback is needed here.  This block is inside
 * AMA_HAVE_NISTP_MONT_MULX_IMPL, which CMakeLists.txt defines only for
 * x86-64 GCC/Clang (`if(... x86_64 ... AND NOT MSVC)`), and both provide C11

/* ============================================================================
 * FIXED-BASE COMB FOR THE GENERATOR
 * ============================================================================ */

/**
 * The generator is a *public constant*, so the doublings its scalar
 * multiplication performs can be done once, at start-up, instead of on every
 * call.  That is the whole idea here, and it is where the time goes:
 * `nistp_scalar_mul` on P-521 runs 132 windows x 4 doublings = 528 doublings
 * plus 132 additions, and 528 doublings is most of a 2.1 ms operation.
 *
 * The comb splits the scalar into `NISTP_COMB_BLOCKS` equal blocks and
 * precomputes every subset sum of the block-aligned multiples
 * `2^(e*j) * G`.  Then one pass over `e` bit positions does *one* doubling and
 * *one* addition each:
 *
 *     acc = 0
 *     for t = e-1 down to 0:
 *         acc = 2*acc
 *         digit = bit(k, t) | bit(k, t+e)<<1 | ... | bit(k, t+3e)<<3
 *         acc = acc + T[digit]
 *
 * At P-521 that is 131 doublings and 131 additions against 528 and 132 — the
 * doubling count falls by 4x, which is the operation the profile is made of.
 *
 * **Four blocks, deliberately, and not eight.**  A comb's table has 2^blocks
 * entries, and the table must be read with a *full linear scan* to keep the
 * memory-access trace independent of the scalar (the same requirement, and the
 * same reason, as in `nistp_scalar_mul`).  Doubling the block count halves the
 * iterations and doubles the per-iteration scan, so the win flattens quickly
 * while the constant-time scan cost grows without bound.  Sixteen entries also
 * keeps the scan *identical in shape* to the one already reviewed for the
 * variable-base path, and the table at 3.5 KB per curve fits comfortably in
 * L1 — an 8-block table would be 56 KB per curve and would not.
 *
 * **Only the generator.**  ECDH multiplies a *peer-supplied* point and keeps
 * `nistp_scalar_mul`: precomputing for a base that changes every call buys
 * nothing, and a table built from attacker-supplied input is a surface this
 * does not need.
 *
 * **Initialised through the platform once-primitive, per curve.**  It used to
 * be a plain `int ready` flag with a comment calling the race benign because
 * "the table holds only public data, so two threads write identical bytes".
 * That reasoning was wrong twice over, and INVARIANT-15 prohibits the pattern
 * outright for exactly these reasons:
 *
 *   - `nistp_comb_build` does not only *write* the table, it *reads it back*:
 *     entry `i` is built by adding to entry `i & ~(1<<low)`.  So two threads
 *     racing produce read/write races on the table, not write/write races on
 *     identical bytes, and a partially written entry is not garbage — the
 *     table lives in BSS, and a Jacobian point whose `Z` limbs are still zero
 *     *is* the point at infinity.  A wrong-but-well-formed answer.
 *   - Even for genuinely identical bytes, a plain flag supplies no
 *     happens-before edge.  On a weakly-ordered target — AArch64 and POWER are
 *     both supported here — a third thread can observe `ready == 1` before the
 *     table stores are visible and multiply against an entry that reads as
 *     infinity, yielding a silently wrong public key or a wrong `r`.  Nothing
 *     reports it; the first thing to notice would be a peer.
 *
 * `pthread_once` / `InitOnceExecuteOnce` gives both exactly-once execution and
 * the visibility guarantee.  After the once-call returns, the table is
 * immutable for the life of the process, so the hot path is a plain read.

 * posture, and the same 2-bit interleaved table, as
 * `secp256k1_point_mul_shamir`.
 *
 * A and B arrive as affine Montgomery coordinates rather than Jacobian
 * points.  That is not a convenience: it is the precondition that lets the
 * inner loop use `nistp_jac_add_affine_vartime` (11 field multiplications)
 * instead of the constant-time `nistp_jac_add` (24).  Taking them as
 * coordinate pairs puts the precondition in the signature, where a future
 * caller cannot quietly violate it by passing an unnormalised point.
 *
 * The third table entry A+B is computed once and normalised to affine so it
 * can be used the same way; the single inversion that costs is repaid many
 * times over across the ~192 additions the loop performs.  A+B is the one
 * entry that can be the point at infinity (exactly when B == -A, which a
 * crafted public key can arrange), so it carries a validity flag and its
 * digit is skipped when it is unavailable — adding infinity is a no-op, so
 * skipping is the correct result, not an approximation.
