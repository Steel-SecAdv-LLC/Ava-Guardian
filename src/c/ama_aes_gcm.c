 * @brief AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption (NIST SP 800-38D)
 * @author Andrew E. A., Steel Security Advisors LLC
 * @date 2026-04-06
 *
 * Implements AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD).
 *
 * Security properties:
 * - T-table free AES core (standard S-box lookup, no T-table acceleration)
 * - 256-bit key, 96-bit nonce (IV), 128-bit authentication tag
 * - Constant-time GHASH via schoolbook multiplication in GF(2^128)
 * - Conforms to NIST SP 800-38D
 *
 * Side-channel WARNING:
 * The S-box is a standard 256-byte lookup table, NOT a bitsliced implementation.
 * The lookup index is state[i] = plaintext[i] XOR round_key[i], which is
 * KEY-DEPENDENT. On processors with data-dependent cache behaviour (virtually
 * all modern CPUs without AES-NI), this makes the implementation vulnerable to
 * cache-timing attacks (Bernstein 2005, Osvik-Shamir-Tromer 2006). Table-based
 * AES is NOT constant-time on general-purpose hardware.
 *
 * Mitigations by deployment context:
 * - Hardware AES-NI / ARMv8-CE: Use hardware instructions (immune to table
 *   timing). This implementation does not currently use AES-NI.
 * - Dedicated hardware / single-tenant: Risk is reduced but not eliminated.
 * - Shared-tenant VMs / hostile co-residency: This implementation is NOT safe.
 *   A bitsliced AES or AES-NI backend is required. This is tracked as a
 *   future hardening item.

 * NIST SP 800-38D length limits (audit Issue 6)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * §5.2.1.1 fixes the AEAD parameter space:
 *
 *   IV (nonce): 1 ≤ len(IV) ≤ 2^64 − 1 bits  (we mandate 96-bit IVs).
 *   AAD:        0 ≤ len(A)  ≤ 2^64 − 1 bits  (~ 2^61 − 1 bytes).
 *   Plaintext:  0 ≤ len(P)  ≤ 2^39 − 256 bits = 2^36 − 32 bytes.
 *
 * The 2^36 − 32 byte limit is derived twice on purpose:
 *
 *   AMA_AES_GCM_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES_DERIVED  — algebraic form
 *       ((2^32 − 2) * 16) matches the original GCM block-count limit
 *       (every 128-bit AES block ≤ 16 bytes, counter wraparound at
 *       2^32 − 2 distinct counter values, so the safe payload is
 *       (2^32 − 2) blocks).
 *
 *   AMA_AES_GCM_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES         — direct NIST form
 *       (1ULL << 36) − 32 bytes  — literally the spec sentence.
 *
 * The static_assert below guarantees the two forms agree to the byte
 * at compile time, so a future refactor cannot silently drift one
 * without the other.  These constants live at TU scope (not inside
 * the encrypt/decrypt entry points) so consumers can include the
 * value from a single source of truth.

/* ============================================================================
 * GHASH (GF(2^128) multiplication for GCM authentication)
 *
 * Implementation: branch-free, table-free word-level multiplication
 * (NIST SP 800-38D §6.3 Algorithm 1).
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE — why this is not a windowed table method.
 *
 * A previous revision used a 16-entry precomputed table H_table[i] =
 * q(i)·H and indexed it with nibbles of the running accumulator.  Its
 * comments asserted that "H_table indices come from AAD/ciphertext
 * bytes, which are non-secret".  That assertion is false for every
 * block after the first.  GHASH is the recurrence
 *
 *     S_i = (S_{i-1} XOR X_i) · H
 *
 * so from the second block onward the value whose nibbles index the
 * table is a function of the secret subkey H = E_K(0^128), not of
 * public data alone.  The 256-byte table spans four cache lines, so on
 * any platform using this scalar path the access pattern leaked H to a
 * co-resident Flush+Reload / Prime+Probe adversary — the same threat
 * model this file already takes seriously for the AES S-box.  Recovering
 * H yields universal forgery under a given nonce, so the leak is
 * authentication-key recovery, not a marginal side channel.
 *
 * The implementation below therefore performs no data-dependent memory
 * access at all: it walks the 128 bits of the accumulator, converts each
 * bit to an all-ones/all-zeros mask, and XOR-accumulates a masked copy of
 * the running multiple of H.  Every operand index is a loop counter, and
 * the doubling step folds its reduction in behind a mask.
 *
 * COST — and this is not a security-for-speed trade.
 *
 * The obvious way to write the above is a 128-iteration loop over a
 * 16-byte array, and that is what the first revision of this fix did.  It
 * cost about 3.2x the throughput of the leaky table (9.5 MB/s against
 * 30.4 MB/s, GHASH isolated on the scalar path, x86-64 sandbox), which was
 * then documented as a deliberate slowdown worth accepting.
 *
 * It was not worth accepting, because it was not necessary.  GCM's
 * bit-string order maps exactly onto two big-endian 64-bit words, so the
 * same masked accumulate that took 16 byte-XORs takes 2 word-XORs, and the
 * 16-byte shift-with-reduction becomes a shrd/shr pair.  Identical
 * algorithm, identical output, no table, same masks — about an eighth of
 * the operations.  Measured on the same host: 71.7 MB/s, which is 7.4x the
 * byte loop and 2.35x the windowed table this replaced.
 *
 * So the constant-time path is now the fast path as well, and the entry in
 * CHANGELOG that once justified a regression records a speedup instead.
 * Hosts with carry-less multiply (x86 PCLMULQDQ via the AVX2/VAES kernels,
 * ARM PMULL via the NEON kernel) still dispatch away from this code
 * entirely; this is what the hosts that cannot now get.
 * ============================================================================ */

/* GHASH multiply in place: Z := Z · H in GF(2^128).
 *
 * NIST SP 800-38D Algorithm 1, with the data-dependent branches replaced
 * by masks:
 *
 *   out = 0;  V = H
 *   for i = 0..127:
 *       out ^= V & mask(bit i of Z)      // bit 0 == MSB of byte 0
 *       V    = V · x                     // branch-free reduction
 *
 * Constant-time: no lookup table exists, every array index is a loop
 * counter, and the per-bit selection is an arithmetic mask rather than a
 * conditional.  The accumulator Z is read but not modified during the
 * loop, so the bit extraction sees a stable operand.
 *
 * The mask goes through ama_ct_value_barrier_u64().  A bare source-level mask
 * is constant-time only in the C abstract machine: a sufficiently clever
 * optimizer can prove the mask is all-zero-or-all-ones, recognise the masked
 * accumulate as the identity in the all-zero case, and branch straight over it
 * — reintroducing a branch on a bit of the accumulator, which is a function of
 * the secret subkey H from the second block onward.  The barrier hides the
 * mask's range so the accumulation stays unconditional regardless of toolchain.
 *
 * Status on the currently-available compilers, re-measured for audit M24: the
 * barrier is FORWARD INSURANCE, not a reproduced fix.  Removing the __asm__ and
 * rebuilding this TU is byte-identical under clang 18.1.3 -O3 and leaves the
 * conditional-branch count unchanged (100 vs 100, a register-allocation-only
 * diff) under gcc 13 -O3 — neither reintroduces the branch here.  An earlier
 * version of this comment asserted clang 18 emitted `bt`/`jae` without the
 * barrier; that does not reproduce on clang 18.1.3 and is withdrawn.  The
 * barrier is kept because it costs nothing and guards against a compiler that
 * does perform the conversion.  See internal/ama_ct_barrier.h, and
 * tools/check_ghash_constant_time.py, which measures this path's retired
 * instruction count under two key classes and fails if it is key-dependent. */

/* Big-endian 64-bit load/store.

 * at bit (63 - i) of the high word for i < 64, and at bit (127 - i) of the
