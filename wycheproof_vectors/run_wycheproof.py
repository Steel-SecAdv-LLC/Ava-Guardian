"""Run the vendored Project Wycheproof corpus against AMA Cryptography.

Wycheproof is a corpus of *adversarial* test vectors — the cases that
break implementations rather than the cases that exercise them.  Running
it against this library for the first time found a real defect in the
first primitive tested (Ed25519 signature malleability, RFC 8032 §5.1.7,
fixed in `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_canonical.h`).  This harness is what
stops that from being a one-off: it is a standing gate over every vector,
run on every pull request.

Offline by construction.  The corpus is vendored under ``vectors/`` and
pinned by ``manifest.json`` — upstream commit, per-file SHA-256, and
per-file vector count.  Nothing is fetched at test time, and a vendored
file that is edited, truncated, or swapped fails the digest check before
a single vector runs.

Every vector lands in exactly one bucket
========================================

``PASSED``
    The library's behaviour matches the vector's expected result.

``FAIL``
    It does not.  Any FAIL fails the build, named with its tcId.

``ACCEPTABLE``
    The vector's own ``result`` is ``acceptable`` — Wycheproof's marker
    for a case where more than one behaviour is defensible — *and* the
    library's behaviour matches a policy in ``ACCEPTABLE_POLICIES``
    below.  Each policy carries the reason the behaviour is defensible
    and the exact number of vectors it covers.  There is no blanket
    "ignore acceptable" bucket: an ``acceptable`` vector that no policy
    claims is a FAIL, and a policy whose count changes is a FAIL.

``OUT_OF_SCOPE``
    The vector exercises an algorithm variant this library does not
    implement — AES-128-GCM, for instance, in a library that ships
    AES-256-GCM only.  Covered by ``SCOPE_POLICIES``, each with a
    reason and an exact expected count, for the same reason as above.

``POLICY_DIVERGENCE``
    The library deliberately disagrees with the corpus.  There is
    exactly one such policy today: Wycheproof scores a high-``s`` ECDSA
    signature ``valid``, because plain X9.62 ECDSA accepts it, and AMA
    rejects it because accepting it is signature malleability.  A
    divergence is only legitimate when it is *stated*, so
    ``DIVERGENCE_POLICIES`` records the reason, pins the exact count,
    and asserts a property every member must have — here, that the
    signature really does carry a high ``s``.  A divergence that starts
    covering a vector for some other reason fails the build.

The three policy tables are the whole point.  A skipped vector with no
stated reason is indistinguishable from a vector that fails, so nothing
is skipped: every one of the vendored vectors is claimed by name or by
an explicit, counted rule, and the totals are asserted.

Exit codes:
    0  every vector accounted for; no failures
    1  a vector failed, a digest or count drifted, a policy went stale,
       or a vector matched no bucket

# Driver tripwire — proof that each driver actually consults the library
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The classifier trusts every driver to call into AMA and report honestly. A
# driver rigged to return a pass for every case would sail through: for an
# `invalid` vector, "the library rejected it" and "the driver ignored its
# input and said pass" reduce to the same PASS, so nothing downstream can tell
# them apart. Only the ECDSA high-`s` divergence count happens to catch a
# hollow ECDSA driver (it would collapse the 72 to 0); HMAC, HKDF, AEAD,
# EdDSA and X25519 had no such backstop.
#
# So before scoring, each driver is handed a vector it genuinely passes and
# then the SAME vector with one byte of a real *input* flipped — the
# signature, the peer key, the MAC/AEAD key, or the HKDF IKM. A correct driver
# must now report a failure (the signature no longer verifies, the shared
# secret / tag / OKM no longer matches) with overwhelming probability; a
# hollow one returns the same verdict for both and fails the gate by name.
# The flipped byte is chosen to avoid the X25519 clamp (byte 0 of the *peer*
# key, which is not masked), so the change always propagates.
#
# ECDSA is the one family where flipping byte 0 would be too weak. Byte 0 of a
# DER `sig` is the SEQUENCE tag (0x30); flipping it only proves the C parser
# rejects *malformed DER*, which the encoding-abuse vectors already cover. To
# prove the ECDSA driver reaches the *curve-math* check, its corruption flips a
# byte inside the `s` integer and leaves the DER framing valid, so the signature
# still parses and is rejected because R.x mod n no longer equals r (see
# _flip_sig_body_byte). DRIVER_TRIPWIRE_CORRUPT holds that per-schema override;
