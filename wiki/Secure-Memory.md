# Secure Memory

Documentation for the secure memory operations module (`ama_cryptography/secure_memory.py`), covering `SecureBuffer`, memory zeroing, memory locking, and constant-time comparisons.

---

## Overview

Cryptographic key material must be handled with care:
- **Zeroed** when no longer needed (prevent exposure via heap dumps, core files, swap)
- **Locked** in RAM (prevent exposure via swap/hibernate)
- **Compared** in constant time (prevent timing side-channel attacks)

The `secure_memory` module provides these capabilities using only the standard library, with optional acceleration via the AMA native C backend.

---

## `SecureBuffer`

A context manager for automatic, guaranteed memory zeroing:

```python
from ama_cryptography.secure_memory import SecureBuffer
import os

# Allocate a 32-byte secure buffer
with SecureBuffer(32) as buf:
    # buf is a bytearray, initially zeroed
    buf[:] = os.urandom(32)   # Load key material

    # Use buf for cryptographic operations...
    key = bytes(buf)

# On context manager __exit__, buf is automatically zeroed
# (multi-pass overwrite, ensuring the key cannot be recovered)
```

### Internal Design

`SecureBuffer.__enter__()` returns a `bytearray` (not `bytes`) because `bytearray` supports in-place modification, allowing the buffer to be zeroed without creating new memory allocations. `bytes` objects in Python are immutable and cannot be zeroed in place.

---

## `secure_memzero()`

Multi-pass memory overwrite for sensitive data:

```python
from ama_cryptography.secure_memory import secure_memzero

# Load sensitive data
secret_key = bytearray(os.urandom(32))

# Use the key...
signature = sign(message, bytes(secret_key))

# Zero immediately after use
secure_memzero(secret_key)
# secret_key is now all zeros
```

> **Important:** Always pass a `bytearray`, not `bytes`. `bytes` objects are immutable and cannot be zeroed.

### Implementation

`secure_memzero()` performs multiple overwrite passes:
1. Fill with `0x00`
2. Fill with `0xFF`
3. Final fill with `0x00`

This protects against "compiler optimization" attacks where a naive `memset()` call to zero is optimized away because the buffer is not subsequently read.

---

## `secure_mlock()` and `secure_munlock()`

Lock memory pages to prevent swapping to disk:

```python
from ama_cryptography.secure_memory import secure_mlock, secure_munlock

secret = bytearray(os.urandom(32))

# Lock the memory page containing `secret` into RAM
# Raises NotImplementedError if native C or POSIX mlock unavailable
secure_mlock(secret)
print("Memory locked in RAM (will not swap)")

# ... use secret ...

# Unlock when done (allow the OS to swap it again)
secure_munlock(secret)

# Zero the memory
secure_memzero(secret)
```

### Platform Notes

| Platform | API | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Linux | `mlock()` | Requires `CAP_IPC_LOCK` or `ulimit -l` ≥ buffer size |
| macOS | `mlock()` | Requires entitlements in sandboxed environments |
| Windows | `VirtualLock()` | Standard user processes have limits |

> **Native C backend:** If the AMA native C library is available, `secure_mlock()` delegates to `ama_secure_mlock()`. Otherwise falls back to POSIX `mlock()`.

---

## `constant_time_compare()`

Timing-safe byte comparison:

```python
from ama_cryptography.secure_memory import constant_time_compare

# Timing-safe comparison (always runs in O(n) time regardless of where mismatch occurs)
hmac_expected = compute_hmac(message, key)
hmac_received = package["hmac_tag"]

# Safe: does not leak position of first mismatch
if constant_time_compare(hmac_expected, hmac_received):
    print("HMAC valid")
else:
    print("HMAC invalid")
```

### Why Constant-Time Matters

A naive comparison (`expected == received`) returns `False` as soon as it finds the first differing byte. An attacker making many requests can measure small timing differences to determine byte-by-byte what the correct HMAC tag is (a timing oracle attack).

`constant_time_compare()` never short-circuits on the first differing byte, preventing this.

### Implementation

Uses `ama_consttime_memcmp()` from AMA's native C library, and **refuses to
operate without it** — there is no pure-Python fallback. Earlier releases fell
back to an XOR accumulator and documented it as constant-time; INVARIANT-7
forbids exactly that substitution for a secret-dependent operation, and the
loop was constant-time only in shape (`ljust` allocates, `zip` builds tuples,
and CPython's small-int cache makes `result |= x ^ y` data-dependent). A
fallback documented as constant-time that is not is worse than no fallback.

Cost is bounded by the **shorter** operand: `min(len(a), len(b))` bytes are
compared in place, and any length difference is OR-ed into the verdict rather
than short-circuiting the scan. Lengths are public metadata here (tags, public
keys and KEM shared secrets each have one published size). The previous
implementation padded both operands to `max(len(a), len(b))`, which let an
unauthenticated package declaring an 8 MiB tag force 16 MiB of allocation to
reject a 32-byte value. Use `lengths_match()` for an explicit, deliberately
non-constant-time length pre-check.

## `SecureKeyStorage`

Encrypted storage with automatic memory management:

```python
from ama_cryptography.key_management import SecureKeyStorage

# encryption_key is bytearray to allow in-place zeroing
encryption_key = bytearray(os.urandom(32))

with SecureKeyStorage(encryption_key) as storage:
    # Store key material (encrypted with AES-256-GCM)
    storage.store("signing-key-v1", os.urandom(32))

    # Retrieve key material (decrypted on access)
    key = storage.retrieve("signing-key-v1")

# encryption_key is zeroed on context manager exit
```

---

## Best Practices

### Do: Use `bytearray` for Key Material

```python
# ✓ Correct: bytearray can be zeroed
key = bytearray(os.urandom(32))
# ... use key ...
secure_memzero(key)
```

```python
# ✗ Incorrect: bytes cannot be zeroed in-place
key = os.urandom(32)   # bytes object
# Cannot zero this after use
```

### Do: Use `SecureBuffer` Context Manager

```python
# ✓ Automatic zeroing even on exception
with SecureBuffer(32) as buf:
    buf[:] = get_key_from_hsm()
    result = encrypt(plaintext, bytes(buf))
# buf is zeroed here, even if encrypt() raised
```

### Do: Lock Sensitive Buffers in RAM

```python
# ✓ Prevent swap exposure for long-lived keys
master_key = bytearray(load_master_key())
secure_mlock(master_key)
# ... use master_key for the session ...
secure_munlock(master_key)
secure_memzero(master_key)
```

### Do: Use Constant-Time Comparisons for MACs and Secrets

```python
# ✓ Constant-time comparison for HMAC tags
if constant_time_compare(expected_mac, received_mac):
    proceed()
```

```python
# ✗ Timing-vulnerable comparison
if expected_mac == received_mac:   # DO NOT USE for secrets
    proceed()
```

## Native C Backend

When the AMA native C library is available (built via CMake), the secure memory module uses it for:
- `secure_mlock()` / `secure_munlock()` via `ama_secure_mlock()` / `ama_secure_munlock()`
- `constant_time_compare()` via `ama_consttime_memcmp()`

Without the native C library, `secure_mlock()`/`secure_munlock()` fall back to
POSIX `mlock()`/`munlock()` via ctypes (and raise on non-POSIX hosts).
`constant_time_compare()` has **no fallback** — it refuses to operate without
the native library, for the reasons in the Implementation section above: the
old pure-Python XOR accumulator was constant-time only in shape, and a
fallback documented as constant-time that is not is worse than no fallback.
