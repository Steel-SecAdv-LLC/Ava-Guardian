## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in AG♱, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead, please:**

1. **Email:** steel.sa.llc@gmail.com
2. **Subject:** [SECURITY] Ava Guardian ♱ (AG♱)  Vulnerability Report
3. **Include:**
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
   - Suggested remediation (if available)
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### What Constitutes a Security Vulnerability

We consider the following to be security vulnerabilities worthy of immediate attention:

**Critical:**
- Cryptographic primitive failures (hash collision, signature forgery)
- Key extraction or recovery attacks
- Authentication bypass
- Arbitrary code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Cryptographic oracle attacks

**High:**
- Side-channel attacks (timing, power analysis)
- Denial of service affecting cryptographic operations
- Information disclosure of sensitive cryptographic material
- Dependency vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries

**Medium:**
- Input validation issues leading to unexpected behavior
- Insufficient entropy in key generation
- Weak random number generation
- Implementation deviations from cryptographic standards

**Low:**
- Documentation inconsistencies affecting security
- Missing security headers or best practices
- Informational security improvements

### Out of Scope

The following are generally **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Theoretical attacks requiring impractical computational resources (e.g., 2^128 operations)
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to upstream maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access attacks on user systems
- Issues requiring user misconfiguration or ignoring documentation
- Performance or availability issues without security impact
- Missing features (use GitHub Issues instead)

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

| Severity | Initial Response | Status Update | Resolution Target |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours        | Every 48 hours | 7 days |
| High     | 48 hours        | Weekly | 30 days |
| Medium   | 5 business days | Bi-weekly | 60 days |
| Low      | 10 business days | Monthly | 90 days |

**Initial Response:** Acknowledgment of receipt and initial severity assessment
**Status Update:** Progress reports and estimated resolution timeline
**Resolution Target:** Expected timeframe for patch release (may vary based on complexity)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure** principles:

1. **Report Received:** We acknowledge receipt within the timeframes above
2. **Validation:** We validate the vulnerability and assess severity
3. **Fix Development:** We develop and test a security patch
4. **Advisory Preparation:** We prepare a security advisory with CVE (if applicable)
5. **Coordinated Release:** We coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter
6. **Public Disclosure:** We publish the advisory and release the patch

**Typical disclosure timeline:** 90 days from initial report, or earlier if:
- A fix is available and tested
- The vulnerability is being actively exploited
- Other parties have independently discovered the issue
- The reporter and maintainers mutually agree

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as follows:

- **Critical vulnerabilities:** Emergency patch release within 7 days
- **High vulnerabilities:** Patch in next minor version (within 30 days)
- **Medium vulnerabilities:** Patch in next scheduled release
- **Low vulnerabilities:** Addressed in regular development cycle

Security advisories are published:
- GitHub Security Advisories (https://github.com/Steel-SecAdv-LLC/Ava-Guardian/security/advisories)
- Release notes with [SECURITY] tag
- Email notification to users who have starred the repository (when critical)

## Responsible Disclosure Recognition

We deeply appreciate security researchers who help keep Ava Guardian ♱ secure. Reporters who follow responsible disclosure will be:

- **Credited** in the security advisory (unless anonymity is requested)
- **Acknowledged** in the CHANGELOG and release notes
- **Thanked** publicly on our GitHub repository
- **Recognized** in our Hall of Fame for significant contributions

We do not currently offer a bug bounty program but may consider recognition rewards for exceptional discoveries.

## Security Best Practices

Users deploying Ava Guardian ♱ in production should:

### Key Management
- **REQUIRED:** Store master secrets in FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ HSMs for production
- **REQUIRED:** Implement key rotation every 90 days
- **REQUIRED:** Use hardware security modules (AWS CloudHSM, YubiKey, etc.)
- **NEVER:** Store private keys in plain text or version control
- **NEVER:** Reuse keys across different Omni-Code packages

### Cryptographic Operations
- **REQUIRED:** Install quantum-resistant libraries (`liboqs-python` or `pqcrypto`)
- **REQUIRED:** Enable all six cryptographic layers (no fallbacks in production)
- **REQUIRED:** Use RFC 3161 trusted timestamp authorities
- **RECOMMENDED:** Use multiple TSAs for redundancy
- **RECOMMENDED:** Verify all signatures before trusting package contents

### Dependency Management
- **REQUIRED:** Keep cryptographic dependencies up to date
- **REQUIRED:** Monitor security advisories for `cryptography` library
- **REQUIRED:** Enable Dependabot for automated security updates
- **RECOMMENDED:** Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds
- **RECOMMENDED:** Verify package signatures from PyPI

### Monitoring and Auditing
- **REQUIRED:** Log all cryptographic operations for audit trails
- **REQUIRED:** Monitor for signature verification failures
- **REQUIRED:** Alert on quantum library unavailability
- **RECOMMENDED:** Implement rate limiting for signature operations
- **RECOMMENDED:** Regular security audits of deployment configuration

## Cryptographic Algorithm Security

### Current Algorithms

| Algorithm | Classical Security | Quantum Security | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| SHA3-256 | 2^128 | 2^128 | ✓ Secure |
| HMAC-SHA3-256 | 2^128 | 2^128 | ✓ Secure |
| Ed25519 | 2^126 | ~10^7 gates* | ⚠ Quantum-vulnerable |
| Dilithium-3 | 2^207 | 2^192 | ✓ Quantum-secure |
| HKDF | 2^128 | 2^128 | ✓ Secure |

*Ed25519 is vulnerable to sufficiently large quantum computers, but Dilithium provides quantum-resistant backup.

### Cryptographic Deprecation Policy

We will deprecate cryptographic algorithms when:
- Practical attacks reduce security below 112-bit classical security
- NIST or other authoritative bodies recommend deprecation
- Quantum computers pose imminent threat to classical algorithms
- More efficient quantum-resistant alternatives become available

**30 days notice** will be provided before deprecating any algorithm, with migration guides and backwards compatibility support.

## Security Audits

Ava Guardian ♱ has undergone internal security analysis documented in `SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md`. We welcome:

- Independent security audits from qualified cryptographers
- Academic review of our mathematical proofs
- Penetration testing of the implementation
- Code reviews focusing on cryptographic correctness

Please contact us at steel.sa.llc@gmail.com to coordinate security audit efforts.

## Compliance and Standards

Ava Guardian ♱ is designed to comply with:

- **NIST FIPS 202** - SHA-3 Standard
- **NIST FIPS 204** - Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (Dilithium)
- **NIST SP 800-108** - Recommendation for Key Derivation Using Pseudorandom Functions
- **NIST SP 800-57** - Recommendation for Key Management
- **RFC 2104** - HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication
- **RFC 5869** - HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)
- **RFC 8032** - Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
- **RFC 3161** - Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol

Non-compliance with these standards should be reported as a high-severity security issue.
