## Overview

AMA Cryptography is a quantum-resistant cryptographic protection system released under the Apache License 2.0 as free and open-source software. As of v2.0, all production cryptographic primitives are implemented natively in C with zero runtime cryptographic dependencies. Security is our highest priority. We take all vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from the security research community.

## Security Features

AMA Cryptography implements defense-in-depth with multiple independent security layers — four core cryptographic operations supported by key derivation, plus an optional timestamp binding that is **not** an independent security layer (see item 6):

1. **SHA3-256 Content Hashing** (NIST FIPS 202)
2. **HMAC-SHA3-256 Authentication** (RFC 2104)
3. **Ed25519 Digital Signatures** (RFC 8032, C11 atomics hardened)
4. **ML-DSA-65 Quantum-Resistant Signatures** (NIST FIPS 204)
5. **HKDF-SHA3-256 Key Derivation** (RFC 5869)
6. **RFC 3161 Timestamp Binding** — *not an independent layer.* AMA verifies the §2.4.2 message-imprint binding only. It does not verify the TSA's CMS `SignerInfo` signature or validate its certificate chain, so an adversary who can supply a token satisfies this check unaided, with any `genTime` they choose, using no key. It contributes no adversarial resistance and must not be counted toward the security bound. See [INVARIANT-37](INVARIANTS.md#invariant-37--a-verification-api-must-not-claim-a-check-it-does-not-perform) and [ARCHITECTURE.md § Scope: RFC 3161 attestation is not implemented](ARCHITECTURE.md#scope-rfc-3161-attestation-is-not-implemented).

### Additional Cryptographic Capabilities

- **AES-256-GCM Authenticated Encryption** (NIST SP 800-38D)
- **ML-KEM-1024 Key Encapsulation** (NIST FIPS 203)
- **SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f and SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s Hash-Based Signatures** (NIST FIPS 205)
- **Adaptive Cryptographic Posture System** (runtime threat-level response)
- **Hybrid KEM Combiner** (IND-CCA2 binding construction per Bindel et al.)
- **Agent-Instance Key/Signature Binding** (INVARIANT-30) — see below

### Agent-Instance Binding (INVARIANT-30)

An autonomous agent driving this library needs two cryptographic capabilities
to outlive its own instance: key material that persists, and signatures a later
instance would treat as authoritative. Ordinary per-message signing and
ephemeral session keys are neither.

A binding names an agent instance, the lifetime of the material it may derive
(`EPHEMERAL` / `SESSION` / `PERSISTENT`), and the capabilities it may exercise
(`DATA_SIGN`, `KEY_EXCHANGE`, `PERSISTENCE`, `SELF_REPLICATE`, `DELEGATE`). Any
non-`EPHEMERAL` lifetime or restricted capability requires a non-zero
ethical-profile hash **and** an `HMAC-SHA3-256` authorization tag verifying
under an operator-held authority key. The canonical 88-byte encoding is folded
into HKDF's `info` and into the ML-DSA / SLH-DSA signature context, so material
derived under one binding is cryptographically unrelated to the same input under
any other — including one differing in a single capability bit.

This is domain separation and policy over the existing SHA3-256 /
HMAC-SHA3-256 / HKDF primitives; **no new algorithm is introduced**
(INVARIANT-1 intact). Refusal is fail-closed: no output bytes, a distinct error
code (`AMA_ERROR_ETHICAL_BINDING` / `EthicalBindingError`), and no partial
state. The policy check is constant-time — verified by a strict dudect lane —
so neither *whether* nor *which* clause refused is observable by timing.

**Operational guidance.** Hold the authority key outside the reach of any agent
that calls the library (an HSM, a separate supervisor process, or an operator
workstation). The binding constrains derivations made *through* it: route
persistence-material derivation through a binding to realise the protection. It
is not a sandbox and does not restrain code that never calls this library.

Two advisory 3R detectors (`VolumeSpikeDetector`, `NoteArtifactDetector`, both
on by default) surface the corresponding runtime behaviour — operation bursts
and signed payloads shaped like instructions for a successor — for human
review. They never block an operation, and a negative result is not a statement
that a payload is benign.

### Performance — Framing

Throughput is a continuously-improving axis, not a ceiling.  On x86-64
AVX2 AMA's checked-in benchmark artifacts and generated reports provide the
only supported throughput claims; avoid quoting relative speedups unless the
source artifact and host class are named. Recent work (see `CHANGELOG.md` from v2.1 onward) added 4-way Keccak
batching, Ed25519 signed-window combs, merged-layer ML-DSA NTT, and
Ed25519 verify via Shamir/Straus joint scalar multiplication with a
width-5 wNAF — roughly doubling verify throughput.

#### What "2× verify" means in practice

Ed25519 verify dominates wall-clock time in three protocol families
that AMA consumers run at scale:

- **X.509 certificate-chain validation** (TLS handshake, code-signing).
  A typical chain is 3–4 certificates deep; each certificate signature
  is one Ed25519 verify.  Doubling per-verify throughput halves the
  CPU budget per chain validation, which on a busy gateway is the
  difference between handling N and 2N concurrent handshakes per core.
- **Noise Protocol Framework handshakes** (WireGuard, Lightning,
  Nym).  The XX, IK and IKpsk2 patterns each do at least one Ed25519
  verify of the responder's static key per handshake; mixed-PQ
  patterns (e.g. `Noise_XXhfs_25519+ML-KEM-1024_*`) keep the same
  verify on the classical leg.  Faster verify shortens the
  Diffie-Hellman-bound handshake critical path.
- **MLS (RFC 9420) group operations.**  Each Welcome / Commit
  message carries one or more Ed25519 signatures over the GroupContext
  and KeyPackages.  In a 1000-member group an Add/Remove can require
  verifying O(log N) signatures along the ratchet-tree path; verify
  speed sets the floor on group-rekey latency.

The change is purely algorithmic — same group-element math, no new
external dependency, no new dispatch slot.  (The compile-time knobs that
once selected between two verify layouts are gone: verify now runs one
path, the half-size-scalar check of `src/c/internal/ama_ed25519_halfsize.h`,
whose verdict is proven identical to the direct group equation and pinned by
the frozen oracle and the RFC 8032 / Wycheproof vectors.)

The deliberate choices that constitute AMA's security posture —
zero external cryptographic dependencies, in-tree constant-time
implementations audited under `INVARIANT-12`, and an in-tree
build-from-source supply chain — auto-bound peak ops/sec against
libraries that lean on AVX-512 or hand-tuned assembly across 500 k+
LoC of audit surface.  Readers who value raw speed over supply-chain
minimalism are unlikely to be the target audience for this library;
readers who need auditable, small-surface post-quantum primitives
with headroom to keep improving should find the trade-off
acceptable.  Measured ops/sec numbers are in `benchmark-report.md`
and `benchmarks/README.md` — any claim to the contrary elsewhere in
the repository should be treated as aspirational and reported as a
documentation bug.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in AMA Cryptography, please report it responsibly:

## Security Best Practices

Users deploying AMA Cryptography in production should:

### Key Management
- **REQUIRED:** Store master secrets in FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ HSMs for production
- **REQUIRED:** Implement key rotation every 90 days
- **REQUIRED:** Use hardware security modules (AWS CloudHSM, YubiKey, etc.)
- **NEVER:** Store private keys in plain text or version control
- **NEVER:** Reuse keys across different Omni-Code packages

### Zero-Dependency Architecture (v2.1)
- **REQUIRED:** Build native C library (`cmake -B build -DAMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=ON && cmake --build build`)
- All production cryptographic primitives (SHA3, HKDF, Ed25519, AES-256-GCM, ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-1024, SLH-DSA, X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id, secp256k1) are native C — no external cryptographic dependencies required
- Optional: numpy/scipy for 3R monitoring, PyKCS11 for HSM

### Cryptographic Operations
- **REQUIRED:** Build native PQC C library (`cmake -B build -DAMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=ON && cmake --build build`)
- **REQUIRED:** Enable all cryptographic layers (no fallbacks in production)
- **REQUIRED (if timestamps are relied upon):** Establish the token's issuer through a control *outside* AMA — an authenticated channel to the TSA, or out-of-band validation of the token before it is stored. AMA verifies the RFC 3161 §2.4.2 message-imprint binding only; configuring a reputable TSA has no verification consequence here, because no TSA signature is checked and a forged token is accepted identically (INVARIANT-37).
- **RECOMMENDED:** Use multiple TSAs for redundancy of *availability*. This is not redundancy of trust: AMA does not verify any of them.
- **RECOMMENDED:** Verify all signatures before trusting package contents

### Dependency Management
- **NOTE:** v2.0 has zero core cryptographic dependencies — all primitives are native C
- **REQUIRED:** Keep optional dependencies up to date (numpy, scipy, pynacl if used)
- **REQUIRED:** Enable Dependabot for automated security updates
- **RECOMMENDED:** Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds
- **RECOMMENDED:** Verify package signatures from PyPI

### Monitoring and Auditing
- **REQUIRED:** Log all cryptographic operations for audit trails
- **REQUIRED:** Monitor for signature verification failures
- **REQUIRED:** Alert on quantum library unavailability
- **RECOMMENDED:** Implement rate limiting for signature operations
- **RECOMMENDED:** Regular security audits of deployment configuration

## Module Integrity Verification (FIPS 140-3 §4.9.1)

### Threat model

The integrity check verifies that an installed wheel's `.py` files
**and its native library** have not been tampered with after build.  It
is **not** a supply-chain identity check (PyPI's existing PGP / sigstore
mechanisms cover that) and it does **not** prove anything about a
malicious build pipeline — both the digest and the signing key are
produced by the same build that produced the code being signed.  The
contract is:

1. The wheel build computes SHA3-256 over the package's `.py` files
   **and a second SHA3-256 over the native library
   (`libama_cryptography`) it is about to ship**, generates an
   **ephemeral, per-build Ed25519 key** by default (or uses
   `AMA_INTEGRITY_SIGNING_SEED_HEX` in release CI), and signs the
   **composite** `SHA3-256(domain ‖ py_digest ‖ native_digest)` — so the
   two digests are inseparable.  It embeds **the signature, the public
   verification key, and both digests** as Python literals in
   `ama_cryptography/_integrity_signature.py`, then **discards the
   private key** before publishing the wheel.
2. At import, `_self_test._verify_signed_integrity()` re-hashes the
   `.py` files, loads the embedded `(pubkey, signature)` pair, verifies
   the signature over the recomputed composite with `ama_ed25519_verify`
   from the in-tree C kernel (via ctypes — INVARIANT-1 forbids a PyCA
   dependency), and then **re-hashes the shared object it actually
   loaded and requires it to match the signed native digest**.  Any
   mismatch — edited `.py` file, edited `.so`, or a swapped signature —
   transitions the module to the ERROR state and refuses every
   cryptographic operation.

   Binding the native library closes the gap where the Python wrapper
   was tamper-evident but the code doing the cryptography was not: a
   back-doored `libama_cryptography` used to leave the `.py` digest, the
   signature and the trust anchor all verifying.  Because `_build_sign`
   can only produce a signature by calling the native `ama_ed25519_sign`,
   a working native library is present at signing time by construction,
   so every signed artefact carries the native digest — there is no
   unsigned-native downgrade path.  The one exception is an explicit
   `AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH` override (see below): the operator has
   deliberately substituted the backend, so the loaded object is
   recorded as **unverified** (a warning, and `fully_verified` is
   `False`) rather than treated as tampering.

There is **no long-lived signing key in developer builds**.  Each
default build generates, signs once, and discards.  Release CI may
compile the expected public key into the native library with CMake's
`AMA_INTEGRITY_TRUST_ANCHOR_PUBKEY_HEX` option and set
`AMA_INTEGRITY_REQUIRE_TRUST_ANCHOR=1`; then the build signer refuses
to emit an artefact whose derived public key does not match the native
anchor, and the import-time verifier fails closed if the embedded
public key is not that anchor.  This gives release packaging a stable
trust-anchor gate without adding any external crypto dependency or
trusting mutable Python source for the anchor.

### Execution integrity — binding the bytecode, not just the source

The signed digest above covers the package's `.py` **source**. CPython
does not execute source; it executes the compiled bytecode in
`__pycache__/*.pyc`. A timestamp-based `.pyc` (the default) is honoured
by the interpreter whenever its stored `(mtime, size)` match the source,
and an attacker with write access to the installed package sets exactly
those. So a poisoned `.pyc` can run while every `.py` stays pristine —
the source digest and its signature both still verify.

A POST stage (`execution-integrity`, run right after the source-integrity
stage) closes this by making on-disk bytecode subordinate to the signed
source: it recompiles each signed `.py` and refuses any cached `.pyc`
whose bytecode is not a faithful compile of it. The comparison is by
executed surface — the instructions and constants, recursively into
nested functions — and ignores the file path and line tables, so a
legitimately relocated wheel is not a false positive while a single
altered instruction is caught. It covers every signed source file, not
only the ones imported so far, so a poisoned `.pyc` for a lazily-imported
module is caught at POST rather than on first use; a source-only run
(no `.pyc` on disk) has nothing to poison and is reported as such. A
second pass rejects any loaded `ama_cryptography` module served from
outside the verified package directory (module substitution). Pinned by
`tests/test_execution_integrity.py`, including an end-to-end case where a
poisoned-but-loadable `.pyc` fails the import while the source digest
stays valid. This is INVARIANT-40.

**Boundary (shared with the trust anchor).** A self-check written in
Python cannot vouch for the bytecode of *its own* module if that was
already poisoned before the check ran, just as the trust anchor lives in
a shared object the same attacker could swap. This stage raises the cost
from "poison any `.pyc`" to "poison the checker's own `.pyc` without
tripping the source signature its source is bound by", but the residual
class is real and is not something an in-process check can eliminate. The
control that does is out-of-band: OS / package-manager code signing (dpkg
/ rpm signatures, a signed wheel verified by the installer, an immutable
or verified-boot filesystem) that authenticates the files before the
Python interpreter loads them. Deploy AMA behind one of those where the
`.pyc`/`.so` tampering threat is in scope; the in-process checks are
defense in depth beneath it, not a substitute for it.

**Why the boundary is not narrowed further in-band (2026-08
reassessment).** The obvious next step — bootstrapping the checker by
`exec`-ing its *source* so its own `.pyc` never runs — was evaluated and
rejected: it moves the trusted base from the checker's module to the
orchestration chain that would perform the exec (`__init__.py` and the
modules it imports first), and every file in that chain lives in the same
directory under the same permissions as the one it replaced. An attacker
with the write access the attack requires can poison `__init__.pyc` as
easily as the checker's `.pyc`, so the narrowing buys complexity, not
security. What *does* help, and costs nothing at runtime, is deployment
posture: install the package read-only (the norm for system site-packages),
or run with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` / `sys.dont_write_bytecode` so no
`.pyc` cache exists to poison — the execution-integrity stage reports the
no-cache case honestly as "nothing to poison" — and let the OS-level
signing above authenticate the tree.

**Supported out-of-band procedure (`tools/verify_install_oob.py`).** The
repository ships a standalone, stdlib-only verifier that performs the
out-of-band check the boundary above defers to, runnable anywhere Python
runs even where OS/package-manager code signing is not deployed. Invoked
in a fresh interpreter against an installed package directory
(`python3 tools/verify_install_oob.py <package-dir> --expected-pubkey <64
hex> [--native-lib PATH]`),
it imports nothing from the target tree: it parses
`_integrity_signature.py` as text (never importing or executing it),
recomputes the `.py`/`_post_kats/` digest and the v1/v2/v3 signed message
exactly as the in-process verifier does, checks the build-time Ed25519
signature, verifies the native-library and binding-extension digests, and
compares every cached `__pycache__/*.pyc` for the invoking interpreter
against a fresh compile of its on-disk source using the same
executed-surface comparison as the execution-integrity POST stage — so a
poisoned `.pyc` is caught by a checker whose own bytecode does not live in
the tree being checked. Its SHA3-256, SHA-512 and Ed25519 verification are
hand-written from FIPS 202 / FIPS 180-4 / RFC 8032 (no OpenSSL-backed
`hashlib`, per INVARIANT-1) and must pass startup known-answer tests,
including a negative control, before anything is verified; a failed
self-test verifies nothing and exits nonzero. Its trust base is stated in
the tool and is deliberately small: the operator's Python interpreter,
that one file — which must itself be obtained out of band (a fresh clone
or a checksum-verified release artifact, never the installation under
test), because relocating the verifier outside the tree's trusted
computing base is the entire point — and the **public key supplied as
`--expected-pubkey`**.

That key is part of the trust base for the same reason the tool is. The
artefact carries the public key it was signed under, so checking the
signature against *that* key shows only that whoever wrote the artefact
also wrote a matching signature; the attacker this tool answers — one
who can rewrite the installed tree — can rewrite the sources, mint a
keypair, re-sign, and leave every digest and the signature agreeing. The
key is therefore compared before the signature is checked, and a tree
signed under any other key is refused however valid its own signature
is. Without `--expected-pubkey` the tool exits 2 rather than reporting a
verdict; `--allow-unanchored` is available for developer trees, whose
artefacts are signed with a per-build ephemeral key no operator holds,
and it labels the result `PASS (UNANCHORED)` and prints the full key, so
what was established (internal consistency) is not confused with what
was not (authenticity). For a release wheel the key to pass is the
compiled trust anchor, read from a trusted copy of the release.

The boundary statement above stands unchanged for the in-process checks:
a self-check written in Python still cannot vouch for its own bytecode,
and this tool is the supported way to check what those checks cannot.

### Pre-load native-library verification — refusing before mapping

Digest-checking the shared object *after* `dlopen` (the original
INVARIANT-39 binding) detects tampering but cannot prevent it from
running: a shared object executes its constructors the moment it is
mapped. Discovery therefore hashes every candidate **before** loading it
and refuses to map an object whose SHA3-256 does not match the signed
`INTEGRITY_NATIVE_DIGEST_HEX` in the integrity artefact. A candidate
whose bytes cannot be read is refused on the same grounds, on every
platform: bytes that cannot be hashed cannot be verified. On Linux the
mapping then goes through `/proc/self/fd` on the very descriptor that was
hashed — the descriptor pins the inode, so the verified bytes and the
mapped bytes cannot be split by swapping the path between the two steps —
and the POST integrity stage compares the *recorded* digest of those
mapped bytes rather than re-reading the file, closing the same race on
the back end.

Stated boundaries, not implied ones: at pre-load time the artefact's
signature cannot yet be verified (the Ed25519 verifier is inside the
library being loaded), so this check defeats the attacker who can replace
the shared object but not re-sign the artefact; one who rewrites both is
caught after load by the signature — or, having re-signed under their own
key, by the trust-anchor comparison on anchored builds, with the
constructor-execution residue that entails. That full-package attacker
remains the OS-code-signing boundary above. An in-place overwrite of the
pinned inode inside the hash-to-map window is not excluded (an attacker
with that write access is caught whenever they write *before* the hash),
and platforms without procfs fall back to hash-then-load with the POST
stage re-verifying after load. Two deliberate carve-outs:
`AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH` (the operator's own substitution — honoured,
digest-recorded, reported UNVERIFIED when the bytes differ) and
`AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1` outside secure-execution mode (the artefact-repair
tools live inside this package and must be able to import it after a
rebuild). Pinned in both directions by
`tests/test_preload_native_digest.py` and the tamper cases in
`tests/test_native_integrity.py`.

Because verification now binds the mapped **bytes**, an
`AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH` override whose bytes are identical to the signed
library reports as verified — a byte-identical copy *is* the signed
library, wherever it was loaded from — while the override's presence
stays visible in `native_backend_diagnostics()`. A modified override
remains UNVERIFIED, never blocked.

**The Cython binding extensions are digest-bound (v3 artefact).** The
composite signature covers the `.py` sources, the POST KAT vectors,
`libama_cryptography`, **and** a per-file SHA3-256 map of the compiled
extension modules (`ed25519_binding`, `hmac_binding`, `sha3_binding`,
`dilithium_binding`, `hkdf_binding`, `math_engine`), serialized into the
signed v3 composite under its own domain string. At import, POST verifies
every extension-suffixed file in the package directory against the
authenticated map, with the same anchored/developer severity split the
native-library check uses: a file whose bytes differ from a signed digest
is tampering and a hard failure on **every** build; a listed-but-missing
or present-but-uncovered extension is a hard failure on **anchored**
(release) builds — where the artefact is generated by the same pipeline
that assembles the wheel, so drift cannot occur legitimately — and a
logged warning on developer builds, where it is the ordinary state of a
source tree whose extensions were built before or after its artefact.
The artefact's schema selects the signed message, so stripping the
binding map from a v3 artefact (or grafting one onto a v2 artefact) is a
signature failure, not a downgrade. The signer refuses to sign a tree
containing an extension module outside its inventory, so a new binding
cannot ship uncovered by omission.

**Both** signing callers bind. `tools/resign_wheel.py` passes
`--bind-extensions`, and so does the repair flow — `integrity --update
--sign` sets it unconditionally before delegating to `_build_sign`
(`ama_cryptography/integrity.py`). Only `_build_sign` invoked directly
without the flag writes an empty map.

An earlier revision of this paragraph said the opposite: that the repair
flow "binds none, since a committed map of one machine's extension
digests would read as a tampering verdict against every other machine's
legitimately rebuilt extensions", and concluded that a source tree's
binding coverage "is not an attestation claim at all". That was true of
the revision it was written for and was inverted when the repair flow
started binding too. It was inverted for a reason: `integrity --update
--sign` is the exact command `_self_test._check_binding_extensions`
prints as the remedy for "present but not covered by the signed
artefact", and without the flag it wrote an empty map, changed the
artefact hash, printed "bindings = 0 extension(s) bound", and reproduced
the identical warning on the next import. The one instruction the failure
message gave could not clear the condition it was given for. The same
stale claim was corrected in `setup.py`'s comment and is pinned there by
`tests/test_setup_signer_contract.py`.

Binding is the correct scope for a repair artefact. It is local by
construction — re-signed with this machine's ephemeral key, replacing
whatever release signature the tree carried — so the "would read as a
tampering verdict on another machine" objection describes copying a
repaired tree elsewhere, where a mismatch is the accurate verdict and
carries this same repair hint. It matches how the native library is
already treated: rebuild it without re-signing and import fails closed,
because the artefact names bytes that are no longer there.

The artefact this repository commits carries a populated binding map:
six extensions, signed on the platform that built them, keyed by exact
filename (ABI tag included). It is a local artefact in the sense above,
and it stays valid only while the tree carries the bytes it names:
rebuild an extension without re-signing and import fails closed on the
digest mismatch — the same treatment the native library gets — while a
checkout whose extensions are not built at all sees six
listed-but-missing entries, a logged warning on developer builds per
the severity split above. Both states are refreshed the same way:
`AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1` with `integrity --update --sign` re-signs the
tree as it stands and rewrites the map. The binding guarantee remains
exact-or-fatal in a shipped wheel, where the artefact and the
extensions are produced by one pipeline.

An earlier revision of this section recorded the gap as blocked on a
release-pipeline change, on the claim that repair tools rewrite the
binding ELFs after signing. Measured, that claim was false for
auditwheel on Linux — the bindings resolve `libama_cryptography`
**inside the package** via `$ORIGIN`/`@loader_path` RUNPATHs, so there
is nothing external to graft: the published v4.0.0 wheels ship every
binding byte-identical to the build (no `.libs`/`.dylibs` directory,
unmangled `DT_NEEDED`, verified on the release assets), and a local
`auditwheel repair` of a freshly built wheel changes only
`RECORD`/`WHEEL` metadata. It was **not** false for delocate on macOS:
the 5.0.0 release dry run showed `delocate-wheel` rewriting every
binding's Mach-O load commands *after* the signer ran, so all five
bindings in the macOS wheels failed their signed digests at the wheels'
own smoke test. The mitigation there is to disable macOS repair
outright (`CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_MACOS: ""` in `release.yml`),
which this project can afford because delocate has nothing to vendor;
Windows repair is disabled for the same reason. The full chain is
exercised end-to-end: a wheel built with the v3 signer, repaired,
installed into a clean environment, passes POST with all six bindings
verified, and refuses to import when any installed binding is modified.

On Linux the pipeline no longer bets on auditwheel continuing to leave
the bindings alone. The default `auditwheel repair` still runs — the
manylinux retagging is worth keeping — and `tools/resign_wheel.py`
(`CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_LINUX` in `release.yml`) then re-signs each
repaired wheel over its **post-repair** bytes: the wheel is unpacked,
the signer is run against the unpacked tree itself (with a hard
verification that the native library it bound came from *inside* that
tree), `RECORD` is regenerated, and the wheel is repacked in place. The
artefact's digests therefore describe the bytes the wheel ships **by
construction**, whatever a future auditwheel version rewrites — the
failure mode delocate exhibited on macOS can no longer invalidate a
shipped Linux signature. The wheel smoke test (`CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`)
still verifies every re-signed wheel end to end before any artefact
ships.

A digest scheme covering only the regions repair tools do not rewrite
(.text-only or section-selective hashing) was considered and rejected,
and the rejection is recorded deliberately: the rewritten regions —
`RUNPATH`/`DT_NEEDED` entries on Linux, Mach-O load commands on macOS —
are precisely the highest-value tamper surface, because they decide
*which shared object the loader binds*. Excluding them from the digest
would trade tamper-evidence on the load path for a compatibility with
post-signing rewrites that the resign-after-repair chain provides in
full while keeping whole-file digests.

Binding extensions are ordinary imports, and an extension's module-init
function runs the moment it is imported — so verification cannot wait
for POST alone. The pre-import gate
(`__init__._refuse_tampered_bindings_before_import`) closes that
asymmetry for the case that is unambiguous tampering: at the top of
package initialisation, ahead of every binding import path, it
recomputes each signed binding digest and **refuses to import** on a
mismatch, before any binding executes. (An earlier revision of this
paragraph said pre-load refusal "would require an import hook"; the
gate achieves the same property without one, because no import path
reaches a binding without initialising the package first.) POST covers
what the gate deliberately leaves to it: inventory drift
(listed-but-missing / present-but-uncovered, whose correct severity
depends on the trust anchor, which lives in the native library the gate
runs ahead of) and authentication of the artefact itself — an attacker
who rewrites both a binding and the artefact is caught by the Ed25519
signature check, not the gate.

### `--update` is build-pipeline-only

`python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --update` is gated behind
`AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`.  Users who modify `.py` files after install
must rebuild the wheel — running `--update` locally would silently
re-bless tampered code and defeat the tamper-detection contract.

### Implementation status

Both halves ship together in the AArch64-completeness PR (2026-05):

1. **`--update` gate** — `python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --update`
   requires `AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1` in the environment.  Outside that
   gate the command exits 2 with a remediation message.  See
   `ama_cryptography/integrity.py`.
2. **Signing pipeline** — `python -m ama_cryptography._build_sign`
    (invoked by the build pipeline, e.g. `setup.py` post-build hook /
    CMake post-install step / wheel CI workflow) generates an ephemeral
    Ed25519 keypair (or uses `AMA_INTEGRITY_SIGNING_SEED_HEX` in
    release CI) via the in-tree `ama_ed25519_keypair` C symbol
    (INVARIANT-1: no PyCA dependency), checks the resulting public key
    against the C-compiled trust anchor when one is present, signs the
    SHA3-256 digest with `ama_ed25519_sign`, writes
    `ama_cryptography/_integrity_signature.py` with the embedded pubkey
    + signature + digest, and discards the private key before exit.
    See `ama_cryptography/_build_sign.py`.
3. **Import-time verifier** — `_self_test._verify_integrity()` calls
    `_verify_signed_integrity()` first.  When the signature artefact is
    present (the normal post-wheel-build state), it recomputes the
    digest, reads any native trust anchor via
    `ama_integrity_trust_anchor_pubkey_hex()`, calls
    `ama_ed25519_verify` via ctypes with the embedded pubkey and
    signature, and accepts only on a positive verify plus trust-anchor
    match when configured.  When the artefact is absent (editable
    installs, source checkouts, wheels built without
    `AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1`), the behaviour depends on
    `AMA_INTEGRITY_REQUIRE_TRUST_ANCHOR`:
    - **Unset (developer / editable / source-checkout path):** the
      module falls back to digest-only verification against
      `_integrity_digest.txt` with a logged WARNING.  Developer
      ergonomics do not require a full wheel build on every edit;
      packagers still see the missing signature in CI logs.
    - **`=1` (release path):** the module refuses to fall back and
      transitions to ERROR state — release wheels MUST ship the
      Ed25519-signed artefact or every crypto call is rejected.  This
      makes a forgotten `AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1` in the release pipeline
      a hard failure instead of a silent posture downgrade.

#### What the integrity check does and does not defend against

State this plainly, because the distinction decides whether the mechanism
is load-bearing for your deployment:

- **Detected:** accidental corruption, partial or interrupted installs,
  drift between the built wheel and the files on disk, and a tampered
  `.py` file when the attacker cannot also rewrite the signature
  artefact.
- **NOT detected without a compiled trust anchor:** deliberate tampering
  by anyone who can write to the installed package directory. The
  verifying public key is read from
  `ama_cryptography/_integrity_signature.py`, which sits beside the code
  it attests. An attacker who edits a module can regenerate the digest,
  sign it with a keypair of their own, and overwrite that artefact; the
  check then passes. Deleting the artefact instead falls back to
  `_integrity_digest.txt`, a plaintext file with no signature at all.
  This is inherent to any self-contained self-check — the anchor is what
  breaks the circularity.
- **Also covered (v2/v3 artefacts):** the native shared library and the
  compiled binding extensions. `_self_test._compute_module_digest`
  hashes the `.py` files, but the signed composite additionally binds
  the SHA3-256 of `libama_cryptography` — enforced before the object is
  mapped (see "Pre-load native-library verification" above) — and the
  per-file digest map of the binding extensions, so a substituted or
  patched shared object is refused, not invisible. The same
  write-capable-adversary caveat as the previous bullet applies: re-sign
  the whole artefact and only a compiled trust anchor catches it. The
  one deliberate exception is an operator's `AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH`
  override, reported UNVERIFIED when its bytes differ; see the note
  below.

A build is only tamper-evident against a write-capable adversary when
`AMA_INTEGRITY_TRUST_ANCHOR_PUBKEY_HEX` is compiled into the native
library (`CMakeLists.txt`) so the embedded pubkey must match an anchor
the attacker cannot rewrite by editing Python, and
`AMA_INTEGRITY_REQUIRE_TRUST_ANCHOR=1` forbids the unsigned fallback.
**Neither is set by default**, so a stock developer build is in the
unanchored state described above.

#### Installing the signing key (anchored releases)

Generate the keypair with AMA's own Ed25519 kernel — no third-party
crypto tool is needed, and using one would contradict INVARIANT-1:

    umask 077
    python3 -c "
    from ama_cryptography.pqc_backends import native_ed25519_keypair
    pk, sk = native_ed25519_keypair()
    open('seed.txt','w').write(sk[:32].hex())
    print('PUBLIC KEY:', pk.hex())
    "

`native_ed25519_keypair()` returns a 64-byte secret key that is
`seed || public_key`; only the **32-byte seed** (`sk[:32]`) is the value
to store. Both stored values are exactly 64 hex characters.

Store them on the repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Value | Kind | Name |
|---|---|---|
| the seed | **Secret** | `AMA_INTEGRITY_SIGNING_SEED_HEX` |
| the public key | **Variable** | `AMA_INTEGRITY_TRUST_ANCHOR_PUBKEY_HEX` |

Then delete `seed.txt` and keep a copy of the seed somewhere durable: the
public half is compiled into published binaries, so the key cannot be
rotated without invalidating the anchor those releases expect.

Run the **Integrity anchor check** workflow (manual trigger) to confirm
the two are a matching pair before tagging a release; a mismatch is
otherwise only surfaced by a failing release build. `release.yml` picks
both up automatically and sets `AMA_INTEGRITY_REQUIRE_TRUST_ANCHOR=1`
only when the anchor variable is non-empty, so forks and
not-yet-configured repositories continue to build unanchored wheels
rather than failing on a missing secret.

#### `AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH`

This environment variable overrides the search for the native library and
loads the named shared object directly. It is a developer convenience for
pointing at an out-of-tree build, and it is a code-execution boundary: a
shared object runs its constructors the moment it is mapped, before the
power-on self-test executes. The loaded object's digest is recorded at load
time and compared against the signed native digest: when the override's
bytes are **identical** to the signed library's, it verifies in full (a
byte-identical copy is the signed library, wherever it was loaded from);
when they differ, the integrity check records the loaded library as
**unverified** (the signature over the artefact still verifies, but the
loaded bytes are not bound to it) — `module_attestation()["fully_verified"]`
is `False` and a warning names the override. Treat the ability to set it as
equivalent to the ability to run code in the process.

It is ignored, with a warning, when the process is running set-uid or
set-gid, matching the dynamic loader's refusal to honour `LD_PRELOAD` and
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in secure-execution mode. When it is honoured, the
override is logged at WARNING so a substituted backend is visible in
operational logs.

#### `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`

The native-library search also consults `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` /
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, which are caller-controlled and steer backend
selection with the same power as `AMA_CRYPTO_LIB_PATH`. The dynamic loader
strips these from a set-uid/set-gid or file-capability process before it
maps anything, but this module reads them directly with `os.getenv`, which
bypasses that stripping — so on a privileged binary a less-privileged
caller's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` could otherwise steer the cryptographic backend
the loader had already protected. Under secure-execution mode these
variables are therefore ignored for backend discovery, with a WARNING,
matching the loader's own rule. On Windows the concept has no referent and
`PATH`-based DLL resolution is unaffected.

#### Partial or mismatched native builds

A shared object can export some primitives and not others — a build with
`AMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=OFF`, a stale library from a previous major version, or
a cross-architecture mismatch. Such a library now surfaces the families it
does **not** provide in `native_backend_diagnostics()["missing_families"]`
and a one-time WARNING at import, rather than presenting as a clean load
with a scattering of unrelated failures at first use. The POST known-answer
tests additionally *call* each covered primitive (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA,
Ed25519, SHA3-256, HMAC-SHA3-256, AES-256-GCM) on a fixed input, so a
mismatched ABI there produces a wrong answer the KAT catches — the check a
bare symbol-presence probe cannot perform. Under `AMA_FIPS_STRICT=1` a
missing covered family hard-fails POST via its skipped KAT.

End-to-end smoke test (from the AArch64-completeness PR's CI):

    AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1 python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --update --sign
    python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --verify   # → "OK (signed integrity verified, ...)"
    # Now edit a .py file and re-import WITHOUT re-running the signer:
    python -c "import ama_cryptography; ama_cryptography._self_test._run_self_tests()"
    # → ERROR state, all crypto operations refused
    # (Re-running the signer over the edited tree makes the check pass again —
    #  see "What the integrity check does and does not defend against" above.)

Release-anchor smoke test:

    export AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE=1
    export AMA_INTEGRITY_REQUIRE_TRUST_ANCHOR=1
    export AMA_INTEGRITY_TRUST_ANCHOR_PUBKEY_HEX=<32-byte expected Ed25519 pubkey hex>
    export AMA_INTEGRITY_SIGNING_SEED_HEX=<32-byte release signing seed hex>
    python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --update --sign
    AMA_INTEGRITY_REQUIRE_TRUST_ANCHOR=1 python -m ama_cryptography.integrity --verify

The release job normally supplies the trust anchor via the compiled
`AMA_INTEGRITY_TRUST_ANCHOR_PUBKEY_HEX` CMake option; the environment
form above is a reproducible local equivalent used by tests to prove
the strict path rejects unanchored artefacts.

### `AMA_FIPS_STRICT` — escalate skipped KATs to POST failure

Released wheels and deployments requiring FIPS-style strictness should set
`AMA_FIPS_STRICT=1` so a missing backend cannot silently degrade the
approved-algorithm self-test set:

  * **Unset (default, developer / docs / CI matrix builds):** when a
    KAT cannot run because its backend is unavailable (e.g. SPHINCS+
    was not built into the C library), the POST runner logs a WARNING,
    records the skip with `passed=None` in
    `module_self_test_results()`, and continues.  Skip is NOT a pass —
    consumers filtering for "everything passed" must compare
    `passed is True`.
  * **`=1` (release / FIPS-strict path):** a skipped KAT is
    escalated to a hard POST failure.  The module enters ERROR state
    and refuses every cryptographic operation until the missing
    backend is built and the process restarted.  This makes a
    forgotten `cmake -DAMA_USE_NATIVE_PQC=ON` in the release build a
    visible failure rather than a silent posture downgrade.

The strict-mode flag applies uniformly to every KAT (SHA3-256,
HMAC-SHA3-256, AES-256-GCM, ML-KEM-1024, ML-DSA-65, SLH-DSA,
SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s, Ed25519) and the constant-time timing oracle.

### `AMA_ALLOW_PYTHON_MEMZERO` — opt into best-effort Python memzero

`secure_memzero` refuses to operate when the native C
zero-on-erase backend is unavailable; the Python multi-pass loop is
opt-in via `AMA_ALLOW_PYTHON_MEMZERO=1` (development / test) or
`AMA_SPHINX_BUILD=1` / `SPHINX_BUILD=1` (docs builds).  Production
deployments should never need the opt-in because INVARIANT-7 already
refuses to import the library without the native HMAC/HKDF backend,
so the native memzero is also present.  The gate is defence-in-depth
against a partial-build state where the constant-time primitives are
linked but the secure-memzero symbol is not.

### Multi-process AES-GCM nonce safety

`AESGCMProvider.encrypt()` reserves its per-key counter slot
atomically via an inter-process file lock before any nonce is
generated or AEAD is invoked.  Concurrent processes sharing the
same AES-GCM key reserve disjoint slots — a previous race window
where two processes could load the same baseline and write back
`max(N+a, N+b)` instead of `N+a+b` is closed.  Ephemeral mode
(`configure_ephemeral(True)` or `ephemeral=True` in the constructor)
bypasses disk I/O for hermetic test runs; in that mode the
multi-process race surface is the same as the historical
single-process design and callers MUST partition keys per-process.
If the host cannot provide a working `fcntl.flock` (POSIX) or
`msvcrt.locking` (Windows) primitive, encryption fails closed instead
of logging and continuing with degraded nonce safety.

The persisted counter path no longer keeps a dirty counter or batching
interval: every successful reservation writes the `slot+1` high-water
mark atomically, so there is no deferred flush state to lose on crash.

### Secure-channel nonce budget per rekey epoch (INVARIANT-22)

INVARIANT-22 requires that exceeding a per-key nonce safety limit force
re-keying or hard failure, never a wrap, reset, or warn-and-continue.
`SecureSession` auto-generates a nonce per message and is therefore in scope.

`SecureSession.encrypt()` draws a fresh random 96-bit nonce for every
message, so nonce reuse within one `(key, rekey_epoch)` pair is a birthday
problem rather than a counter overflow: after n encryptions the collision
probability is about n² / 2⁹⁷.

`MAX_ENCRYPTIONS_PER_EPOCH` (2²⁰) bounds it, checked *before* the nonce is
drawn, and `encrypt()` raises `RekeyRequiredError` on reaching it. Recovery is
the caller's: call `rekey()` on **both** peers, or close the session. The
library deliberately does not rekey for you — the AEAD associated data binds
`rekey_epoch`, so a unilateral rekey desynchronises the pair and every
subsequent message fails authentication at the far end.

Crossing the advisory `REKEY_INTERVAL` (1000 messages, counting both
directions) logs one WARNING per epoch. The ceiling binds the sender only:
`decrypt()` generates no nonces, so enforcing it on receive would break a peer
running an older build without improving this side's margin.

### FROST nonce hedging — what it covers, and what it does not

Round-1 nonces are derived as
`SHA-512(label || random(32) || share_secret(32)) mod l`, so nonce secrecy does
not rest on the CSPRNG alone: an adversary who can *predict* the RNG output
still cannot compute the nonce without the participant's secret share. The two
nonces in a pair use distinct domain-separation labels and therefore cannot
collide with each other.

**It does not protect against an RNG that repeats.** The derivation is a pure
function of its three inputs and holds no state, so a participant handed the
same random bytes twice emits the identical nonce — a VM restored from a
snapshot, a fork inheriting a buffered pool, several hosts re-seeded from one
image. Two partial signatures over different messages under one Schnorr nonce
disclose that participant's secret share by subtraction, so an RNG replay is a
full compromise of the share, and no amount of hashing inside the derivation
can prevent it.

RFC 9591's own `nonce_generate` has the same property. Only per-signature state
would change it — a counter, or binding the message in — and neither is
available to a round-1 API that runs before the message is known. **Preventing
RNG-state rollback is therefore a deployment obligation**, not a property this
library provides: do not snapshot-and-restore a signing host, and do not clone
a VM image that has already signed. `tests/c/test_frost.c` pins the repeat
behaviour as a known limit so it cannot be mistaken for a defect later, or
quietly assumed away.

### Key-store KDF parameters are untrusted input

`.kdf_metadata.json` names the algorithm and cost that turn the master
password into the storage key, and it is an unauthenticated file in the key
directory. Anyone who can write it can name a cheaper derivation.

This does **not** expose keys already stored — those were encrypted under a key
derived with the old parameters, so a swapped file simply fails to decrypt
them. What it governs is every key written *afterwards*, and on a store that is
initialised but not yet populated the downgrade leaves no trace at all.

`SecureKeyStorage` therefore clamps the parameters from below on read and
raises `KDFPolicyError` rather than deriving a weak key:

| Parameter | Floor | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Algorithm | Argon2id, where the build provides it | this section |
| PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 iterations | 600,000 | OWASP 2024 |
| Argon2id `t_cost` | 3 | RFC 9106 §4 |
| Argon2id `m_cost` | 65536 KiB (64 MiB) | RFC 9106 §4 |
| Argon2id `parallelism` | 1 | RFC 9106 §4 |

The algorithm row is load-bearing and not a formality. Clamping costs *within*
an algorithm leaves the cheapest attack intact: name a different one. The
metadata's `version` field selects the Argon2id branch, so deleting that single
field re-routes derivation to PBKDF2 — and PBKDF2 at exactly 600,000 iterations
satisfies every cost floor above while discarding memory-hardness entirely,
which is the property Argon2id is chosen for and the one that costs a GPU or
ASIC attacker real money. On a build with native Argon2id, metadata naming
PBKDF2 is therefore refused. Builds without native Argon2id are unaffected,
because PBKDF2 is what such a build legitimately creates stores with.

Storage format v3 also binds the KDF parameters into the AEAD associated data
and records them in each key file. The parameters already influence the derived
key, so this adds *provenance*, not confidentiality: the recorded cost cannot
be edited without invalidating the tag, and a mismatch is reported as a named
`KDFPolicyError` rather than an unexplained authentication failure. Format v2
records (which bound `key_id` alone) are still read.

To open a genuine legacy store, pass `allow_legacy_kdf=True` — which warns
instead of raising — then call `migrate_kdf(password)` to re-encrypt at current
strength and reopen without the flag.

*Ed25519 and X25519 are vulnerable to sufficiently large quantum computers, but ML-DSA-65 provides quantum-resistant backup.

### Cryptographic Deprecation Policy

We will deprecate cryptographic algorithms when:
- Practical attacks reduce security below 112-bit classical security
- NIST or other authoritative bodies recommend deprecation
- Quantum computers pose imminent threat to classical algorithms
- More efficient quantum-resistant alternatives become available

**30 days notice** will be provided before deprecating any algorithm, with migration guides and backwards compatibility support.

### Performance note on the VAES AES-GCM dispatch path (x86-64)

The library ships an optional VAES + VPCLMULQDQ AES-256-GCM kernel
(PR A, 2026-04) behind runtime CPUID + XCR0 gating
(`ama_cpuid_has_vaes_aesgcm()`). The VAES + VPCLMULQDQ AES-GCM path
targets **YMM (256-bit), not ZMM**: Zen 3+ / Ice Lake+ CPUs execute
these without the AVX-512 ZMM frequency penalty documented for
Skylake-SP / Cascade Lake. Cloud VM variance on shared hosts is still
the dominant noise source; published throughput numbers are from
bare-metal runs, not CI. Hosts without VAES — or any non-x86-64
host — automatically route through the AVX2 AES-NI + PCLMULQDQ path
shipped in #253 / #254 / #260 / #261, which remains the regression
baseline tracked in `benchmarks/baseline.json`.

## Security Audits

AMA Cryptography has undergone internal security analysis documented in this file. We welcome:

- Independent security audits from qualified cryptographers
- Academic review of our mathematical proofs
- Penetration testing of the implementation
- Code reviews focusing on cryptographic correctness

Please contact us at steel.sa.llc@gmail.com to coordinate security audit efforts.

## Compliance and Standards

AMA Cryptography is designed to comply with:

- **NIST FIPS 202** - SHA-3 Standard (SHA3-256, SHAKE128, SHAKE256)
- **NIST FIPS 203** - Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM / Kyber)
- **NIST FIPS 204** - Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA / Dilithium)
- **NIST FIPS 205** - Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+)
- **NIST SP 800-38D** - Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes: GCM (AES-256-GCM)
- **NIST SP 800-57** - Recommendation for Key Management
- **RFC 2104** - HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication
- **RFC 5869** - HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)
- **RFC 8032** - Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

**Partial, and deliberately so:**

- **RFC 3161** - Time-Stamp Protocol. AMA verifies the §2.4.2 message-imprint
  binding *only*. It does **not** verify the TSA's CMS `SignerInfo` signature,
  does **not** validate the signing certificate chain, and therefore treats
  `TSTInfo.genTime` as attacker-chosen data — see the explicit `tsa_signature`
  / `tsa_certificate_chain` / `gen_time` `False` declarations in
  `ama_cryptography/rfc3161_timestamp.py`, item 6 of the layer list above, and
  [INVARIANT-37](INVARIANTS.md#invariant-37--a-verification-api-must-not-claim-a-check-it-does-not-perform).
  It contributes no adversarial resistance and must not be counted toward the
  security bound.

Non-compliance with the fully-implemented standards above should be reported as a high-severity security issue.

| 3.1.0 | 2026-05-14 | Security hygiene release documentation alignment for current consumers, v3.1.0 tag legitimacy, INVARIANT-14 CVE-ignore review, and no public API changes since v3.0.0 |
| 3.2.0 | 2026-05-20 | Mercury Agent v1.7.0 alignment; per-slot SIMD auto-tune + file-based cross-process dispatch cache with dispatch-cache safety; NTT benchmark overflow guard; dudect CI hygiene; native HMAC-SHA-256 Python bindings; no breaking public API changes |
| 3.3.0 | 2026-07-05 | Native one-shot SHA-256; documented public MAC/KDF surface (`quick_hmac` / `quick_hkdf`, native HMAC/HKDF SHA-2/3, `AmaCryptographyError` exception root); SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f signer consolidation; native-hashing purity in `crypto_api`; SLSA provenance permissions + CodeQL unused-static resolution |
| 3.4.0 | 2026-07-25 | Support matrix rolled (3.4.x active); vendored Wycheproof gate; Ed25519 canonical-`S` enforcement (INVARIANT-26) and X25519 u-coordinate canonicalization (INVARIANT-27); agent-instance binding (INVARIANT-30) with 3R detectors; Ascon-AEAD128/Hash256 (SP 800-232) |
| 3.5.0 | 2026-07-30 | Support matrix rolled (3.5.x active, 3.4.x superseded — no public API removals); INVARIANT-22 nonce-counter rollback residual risk documented; NIST P-256/384/521 ECDSA (FIPS 186-5, INVARIANT-34 low-`s` policy), ML-KEM/ML-DSA parameter sets, HSS/LMS verification enter the supported surface |
| 4.0.0 | 2026-08-01 | Support matrix rolled (4.0.x active, 3.5.x superseded — six breaking changes); trust-anchor enforcement end to end; constant-time scalar GHASH with an optimizer value barrier; Ed25519 canonical-`y` (INVARIANT-38); KDF policy floor on both cost and algorithm; per-epoch AEAD nonce budget (INVARIANT-22); package serialization and `SecureSession` no longer emit key material; RFC 8439 length limit on ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| 5.0.0 | 2026-08-14 | Support matrix rolled (5.0.x active, 4.0.x superseded — ten breaking changes); fail-closed FIPS 140-3 POST import with output inhibition on every surface (INVARIANT-39/-40); pairwise consistency test on every asymmetric keygen (INVARIANT-41); declared-ctypes-ABI cross-check and loaded-library major-version handshake (INVARIANT-42); pre-load native-library digest verification with the fail-closed unreadable-candidate rule; the six binding extensions digest-bound into the v3 integrity artefact (every build signs and binds, including the repair flow; anchored/developer severity split); Ed25519 `x = 0` twin-encoding rejection, extended to the signature's R half on every verify path in both backends so batch and single verify cannot disagree; `CryptoPostureController` fail-closed on an algorithm it cannot rank, with per-family strength ladders so an escalation cannot answer a KEM with a signature scheme; pre-load refusal of a binding extension whose digest does not match the signed artefact (previously verified only after it had executed); the `AMA_BUILD_PIPELINE` carve-out that let an environment variable buy a mapping of an unverified native library replaced with an in-process signing-only scope; ML-KEM `Compress_d` applies its own `mod 2^d` with an exhaustive 16,645-pair proof; SoftHSM2, the semgrep end-to-end assertion, `test_dispatch_cache_file` on SIMD-off builds and `test_pq_parser_stack` under Valgrind all made executable; the dudect verdict rule distinguishes a directional leak from an unusable measurement |
