## Overview

Ava Guardian ♱ includes optional runtime security monitoring using the 3R Mechanism, a security framework developed by Steel Security Advisors LLC. The 3R Mechanism provides three complementary approaches to runtime security analysis:

| Component | Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| ResonanceEngine | Runtime timing anomaly monitoring | Frequency-domain analysis of operation timings (statistical anomaly detection) |
| RecursionEngine | Pattern analysis | Hierarchical anomaly detection across time scales |
| RefactoringEngine | Code complexity metrics | Static analysis for manual security review |

**Design Philosophy**: The 3R Mechanism follows a strict observe-analyze-alert paradigm. It never automatically modifies cryptographic code, ensuring that all security-critical changes require human review and approval.

## Component Deep Dive

### ResonanceEngine: Runtime Timing Anomaly Monitoring

**Purpose**: Surface statistical timing anomalies through frequency-domain analysis for security review.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a MONITORING system that surfaces statistical anomalies. It does NOT guarantee detection or prevention of timing attacks or other side-channel vulnerabilities. Constant-time implementations at the cryptographic primitive level are the primary defense against timing side-channels.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Record operation timings (e.g., Ed25519 sign, Dilithium verify)
2. Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to timing samples
3. Detect periodic patterns (resonance) indicating side-channels
4. Alert on statistical anomalies (>3σ deviations)

**Anomaly Patterns Monitored** (examples of behaviors that can produce distinctive timing signatures; the system surfaces anomalies but does not guarantee detection of any particular attack):
- Cache timing patterns (e.g., Bernstein's attack on AES)
- Branch prediction leakage patterns
- Memory access pattern correlations
- CPU microarchitecture timing variations

**Configuration**:
- `threshold_sigma`: Anomaly sensitivity (default: 3.0)
- `window_size`: FFT sample window (default: 100)
- `max_history`: Memory limit per operation (default: 10,000)

**Performance**: <0.5% overhead per monitored operation

### RecursionEngine: Hierarchical Pattern Analysis

**Purpose**: Detect anomalies in signing patterns across multiple time scales.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Record package signing metadata (timestamp, author, code count)
2. Extract time-series features (inter-package intervals)
3. Recursive downsampling: Level 0 (raw) → Level 1 (2x) → Level 2 (4x)
4. Compute statistics at each scale: mean, std, range
5. Detect anomalies via z-score analysis (>3σ)

**Detected Anomalies**:
- Unusual signing frequency (burst or drought)
- Package size deviations (too many/few codes)
- Multi-scale pattern changes (gradual vs. sudden)

**Configuration**:
- `max_depth`: Recursion levels (default: 3)  
- `max_history`: Package history limit (default: 10,000)

**Performance**: O(n log n) for n packages, <1% overhead

---

### RefactoringEngine: Code Complexity Analysis

**Purpose**: Provide complexity metrics for manual security review.

**⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: This component is **READ-ONLY**. It never modifies cryptographic code automatically.

**Why No Auto-Refactoring?**:
- May introduce subtle vulnerabilities
- Bypasses mandatory code review  
- Could weaken cryptographic guarantees
- Violates principle of least privilege

**Metrics Calculated**:
1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: M = 1 + (decision points)
   - 1-10: Simple, easy to test
   - 11-20: Moderate complexity
   - 21+: Refactor recommended

2. **Lines of Code**: Per-function and per-file

3. **Complexity Distribution**: Mean, max, high-complexity count

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from ava_guardian_monitor import AvaGuardianMonitor
from code_guardian_secure import *

# Enable monitoring
monitor = AvaGuardianMonitor(enabled=True)

# Generate keys
kms = generate_key_management_system("Steel-SecAdv-LLC")

# Create monitored package
pkg = create_crypto_package(
    MASTER_OMNI_CODES_STR,
    MASTER_HELIX_PARAMS,
    kms,
    "author",
    monitor=monitor  # ← Pass monitor here
)

# Get security report
report = monitor.get_security_report()
print(f"Status: {report['status']}")
print(f"Total alerts: {report['total_alerts']}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Custom thresholds
monitor = AvaGuardianMonitor(
    enabled=True,
    alert_retention=5000  # Keep last 5000 alerts
)

# Configure timing sensitivity
monitor.timing.threshold = 2.5  # More sensitive (2.5σ vs 3σ)
monitor.timing.window_size = 200  # Larger FFT window

# Configure pattern analysis
monitor.patterns.max_depth = 4  # Deeper recursion
```

## When to Enable Monitoring

### Production Scenarios

**Enable Monitoring When**:
- Processing sensitive or high-value Omni-Codes
- Compliance requires audit trails
- Security incident investigation
- Performance regression testing
- Post-deployment validation

**Disable Monitoring When**:
- Maximum performance required
- Resource-constrained environments
- Development/testing with dummy data
- Batch processing non-sensitive data

### Performance Impact

| Scenario | Overhead | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Light monitoring (timing only) | <1% | Safe for production |
| Full monitoring (3R active) | 1-2% | Acceptable for most cases |
| Resonance analysis enabled | <0.5% | Minimal added cost |
| Pattern analysis (1000+ packages) | <1% | Scales well |

**Total Impact**: <2% when all components enabled

## Security Considerations

### Log Security

Monitoring data can contain sensitive information:

**Timing Data**: May leak information about:
- Key sizes (via operation duration)
- Data sizes (via hash computation time)
- System load patterns

**Mitigation**:
- Store logs securely (encrypt at rest)
- Limit log retention (default: 10,000 entries)
- Control access (require authentication)
- Rotate logs regularly

### Alert Rate Limiting

Prevent denial-of-service via alert spam:

```python
# Built-in: max 1000 alerts retained by default
monitor = AvaGuardianMonitor(alert_retention=1000)

# Alerts auto-pruned to prevent memory exhaustion
```
