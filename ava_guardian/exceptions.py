Ava Guardian ♱ Exception Classes
=================================

Centralized exception and warning classes for the Ava Guardian package.
All modules should import exceptions from this module to ensure consistency.

"""


class SecurityWarning(UserWarning):
    """
    Warning for security-related issues in cryptographic configurations.

    Used to alert users about potentially unsafe or suboptimal security
    configurations without raising an exception. Examples include:
    - Using non-constant-time implementations
    - Legacy encryption formats
    - Missing recommended security features
    """

    pass


class PQCUnavailableError(RuntimeError):
    """
    Raised when post-quantum cryptography is required but unavailable.

    This exception indicates that a PQC operation was requested but the
    necessary backend (liboqs-python or pqcrypto) is not installed.

    Inherits from RuntimeError to maintain backward compatibility with
    existing tests and code that expects this exception hierarchy.

    To resolve, install one of:
        pip install liboqs-python  # Recommended, requires Python 3.10+
        pip install pqcrypto       # Alternative, pure Python
    """

    pass


class QuantumSignatureUnavailableError(PQCUnavailableError):
    """
    Raised when quantum-resistant signature operations are requested but
    the required libraries (liboqs-python or pqcrypto) are not available.

    This exception ensures fail-closed behavior for quantum signatures,
    preventing the system from silently degrading to insecure placeholders.

    Inherits from PQCUnavailableError for catch-all handling.
    """

    pass


class CryptoConfigError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when cryptographic configuration is invalid.

    This includes invalid algorithm selections, incompatible parameters,
    or missing required configuration values.
    """

    pass


class KeyManagementError(Exception):
    """
    Base exception for key management operations.

    Raised for errors in key derivation, rotation, storage, or retrieval.
    """

    pass


class SignatureVerificationError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when signature verification fails.

    This indicates the signature is invalid, the data was tampered with,
    or the wrong public key was used for verification.
    """

    pass


class IntegrityError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when data integrity verification fails.

    This includes HMAC verification failures, hash mismatches, or
    other integrity check failures.
