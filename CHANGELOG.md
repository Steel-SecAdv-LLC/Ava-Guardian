## [Unreleased]

### Added - Constant-Time Verification and NIST KAT Documentation

**Enhancement:** Added dudect-style timing analysis harness and documented NIST KAT coverage.

#### Summary

Addresses remaining security audit concerns by adding constant-time verification tooling and documenting existing NIST KAT test vector coverage.

#### Changes

- **Constant-Time Verification (`tools/constant_time/`):**
  - `dudect_harness.c`: Implements Welch's t-test timing analysis for all 5 constant-time functions
  - `Makefile`: Build system with `make test` (100K iterations) and `make test-full` (1M iterations)
  - Tests: `ava_consttime_memcmp`, `ava_consttime_swap`, `ava_secure_memzero`, `ava_consttime_lookup`, `ava_consttime_copy`
  - Threshold: |t| < 4.5 (dudect convention, ~10⁻⁵ false positive probability)

- **Documentation:**
  - `CONSTANT_TIME_VERIFICATION.md`: Methodology documentation with scope table
  - `README.md`: Added "Constant-Time Verification" and "NIST KAT Validation" sections
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`: Added NIST KAT and constant-time verification to pre-deployment checklist
  - `SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md`: Updated limitations section to reflect addressed concerns

- **Header Fix (`include/ava_guardian.h`):**
  - Fixed `ava_consttime_lookup` parameter order to match implementation (table_len, elem_size)

#### Security Analysis

The dudect-style harness provides statistical timing analysis, not formal verification. Results indicate no detectable timing leakage under tested conditions. Environment-sensitive; run on target hardware for production validation.

### Changed - HKDF Algorithm Unification

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Unified HKDF key derivation to use SHA3-256 instead of SHA-256.

#### Summary

The `derive_keys()` function now uses `HKDF-SHA3-256` instead of `HKDF-SHA256` for key derivation. This aligns the HKDF algorithm with the project's SHA3 emphasis and ensures consistency across all cryptographic primitives.

#### Changes

- **Code (`dna_guardian_secure.py`):**
  - `derive_keys()`: Changed `algorithm=hashes.SHA256()` to `algorithm=hashes.SHA3_256()`
  - Updated docstring to reflect SHA3-256 usage
  - Added explanatory comment about RFC 5869 and HMAC-SHA3-256 as secure PRF

- **Documentation (`SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md`):**
  - Updated all HKDF references from SHA-256 to SHA3-256
  - Fixed HKDF security theorem to reference HMAC-SHA3-256
  - Updated compliance tables to show HKDF-SHA3-256
  - Corrected all numeric bounds and parameters

- **Tests (`tests/test_hkdf_sha3_256.py`):**
  - Added 16 comprehensive tests for HKDF-SHA3-256
  - Golden vector tests for reproducibility verification
  - Ethical context integration tests
  - Key independence and determinism tests

- **Configuration (`pytest.ini`):**
  - Added filter for liboqs version mismatch warning

#### Security Analysis

HMAC-SHA3-256 is a secure PRF, and HKDF-SHA3-256 maintains equivalent security to HKDF-SHA256:
- PRF security: 2^-128 (unchanged)
- Key derivation security: 2^-256 (unchanged)
- Collision resistance: 2^-128 (unchanged)

While RFC 5869 was written for HMAC with Merkle-Damgard hashes, HMAC-SHA3-256 provides the same PRF guarantees required by HKDF.

#### Breaking Change Impact

**⚠️ Keys derived with v1.0.0 will differ from keys derived with this version.**

- Applications using `derive_keys()` must regenerate all derived keys
- Existing `DNA_CRYPTO_PACKAGE.json` files remain valid (signatures unchanged)
- Only key derivation is affected, not hashing or signatures

#### Migration Path

1. Regenerate all derived keys using updated `derive_keys()` function
2. Update any stored derived keys in your application
3. No changes needed for existing signed packages

## PLANNED FOR v2.0.0

> **⚠️ WARNING:** The features below are NOT included in v1.0.0. They are planned for future releases.

### Ethical Integration (Planned)

**Major Enhancement:** Mathematical integration of 12 DNA Code Ethical Pillars into cryptographic framework.

#### New Features

- **Ethical Vector Integration:**
  - 12-dimensional ethical vector (4 triads × 3 pillars)
  - Balanced weighting constraint: Σw = 12.0
  - Cryptographic binding via SHA3-256 ethical signatures
  
- **Enhanced Key Derivation:**
  - `create_ethical_hkdf_context()`: Integrates ethical vector into HKDF
  - Enhanced HKDF with 128-bit ethical signature in context parameter
  - Maintains RFC 5869 compliance and security level (2^-128)
  
- **CryptoPackage Schema Extension:**
  - New field: `ethical_vector` (Dict[str, float]) - 12 DNA Code Ethical Pillars
  - New field: `ethical_hash` (str) - SHA3-256 hash of ethical vector for verification
  
- **KeyManagementSystem Enhancement:**
  - New field: `ethical_vector` stored with KMS for consistency
  - Keys cryptographically bound to ethical constraints
  
- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
  - SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md: Added Section 5.1 "Ethically-Bound HKDF Context" with formal mathematical proofs
  - IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md: Added complete migration guide for v1.0.0 → v2.0.0
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Complete system architecture documentation (387 lines)
  
- **Performance Benchmarking:**
  - `benchmark_suite.py`: Comprehensive performance testing framework (400 lines)
  - `benchmark_results.json`: Live performance data
  - Validated <4% overhead for ethical integration in full package creation

#### Changed

- **HKDF Key Derivation:**
  - `derive_keys()` now accepts optional `ethical_vector` parameter
  - Enhanced context includes 128-bit ethical signature
  - Backward compatible: defaults to ETHICAL_VECTOR if not specified
  
- **Package Creation:**
  - `create_crypto_package()` now includes ethical vector and hash
  - `generate_key_management_system()` accepts optional `ethical_vector`
  
- **Test Suite:**
  - Updated `test_demonstration.py` for improved quantum library detection
  - Enhanced test robustness with subprocess-based validation

#### Security Analysis

**Mathematical Proof (Section 5.1 of SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md):**

Theorem: If SHA3-256 is collision-resistant and HMAC-SHA256 is a PRF, then HKDF with ethically-bound context remains a secure KDF with security level 2^-127 ≈ 2^-128.

**Security Properties:**
- Maintains HKDF collision resistance (2^-128)
- Provides cryptographic binding to ethical constraints
- Enhanced domain separation via ethical signature
- Non-repudiation of ethical configuration

**Standards Compliance:**
- ✓ RFC 5869 (HKDF): Fully compliant - uses standard context parameter
- ✓ NIST FIPS 202 (SHA3-256): Fully compliant
- ✓ NIST SP 800-108: Compliant with KDF best practices

**Performance Impact:**
- Ethical signature computation: <2 μs per key derivation
- Full package creation overhead: <4% (from 0.30ms baseline)
- Throughput maintained: >3,300 packages/second

#### Breaking Changes

**⚠️ BREAKING: CryptoPackage Schema**

The `CryptoPackage` dataclass now includes two new required fields:
- `ethical_vector: Dict[str, float]`
- `ethical_hash: str`

**Impact:**
- Code deserializing v1.0.0 `DNA_CRYPTO_PACKAGE.json` files will fail
- Applications must migrate to v2.0.0 schema

**Migration Path:**
1. Regenerate all packages with v2.0.0 (recommended)
2. Use backward-compatible loader with default ethical vector
3. Batch migration script for multiple packages

See IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md "Migration Guide" section for detailed instructions.

#### Security Assessment

The system maintains secure and tested defense-in-depth architecture. Ethical integration:
- Does not weaken cryptographic security (proven mathematically)
- Adds contextual binding and domain separation
- Provides additional security properties through ethical constraints

### Version Planning

These changes are planned for **v2.0.0** release due to breaking changes in `CryptoPackage` schema. Release date to be determined.
